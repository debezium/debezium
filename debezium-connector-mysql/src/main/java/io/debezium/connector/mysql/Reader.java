 * A component that reads a portion of the MySQL server history or current state.

 * A reader starts out in the {@link State#STOPPED stopped} state, and when {@link #start() started} transitions to a
 * {@link State#RUNNING} state. The reader may either complete its work or be explicitly {@link #stop() stopped}, at which
 * point the reader transitions to a {@value State#STOPPING stopping} state until all already-generated {@link SourceRecord}s
 * are consumed by the client via the {@link #poll() poll} method. Only after all records are consumed does the reader
 * transition to the {@link State#STOPPED stopped} state and call the {@link #uponCompletion(Runnable)} method.
 * <p>
 * See {@link ChainedReader} if multiple {@link Reader} implementations are to be run in-sequence while keeping the
 * correct start, stop, and completion semantics.
