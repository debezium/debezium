-- In production you would almost certainly limit the replication user must be on the follower (replica) machine,
-- to prevent other clients accessing the log from other machines. For example, 'replicator'@'follower.acme.com'.
-- However, in this database we'll grant 3 users different privileges:
--
-- 1) 'replicator' - all privileges required by the binlog reader (setup through 'readbinlog.sql')
-- 2) 'snapper' - all privileges required by the snapshot reader AND binlog reader
-- 3) 'mysqluser' - all privileges
