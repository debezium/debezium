 * A utility class for emitting OpenLineage events from Debezium connectors.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as a facade for the underlying OpenLineage integration, providing
 * static methods for initializing the emitter and emitting lineage events at various
 * points in the Debezium connector lifecycle. The implementation uses a thread-safe
 * approach to ensure proper initialization across multiple threads.
 * <p>
 * The emitter will only be active if OpenLineage integration is enabled in the configuration.
 * Otherwise, a no-operation implementation is used that performs no actual emission.
