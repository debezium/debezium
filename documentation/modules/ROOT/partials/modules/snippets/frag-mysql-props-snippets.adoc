= MySQL snippets used in properties descriptions


// This file is called from shared-mariadb-mysql.adoc to render content that is specific to one of the two databases.
// Using this approach because the Nebel tool that is used to prepare the downstream docs does not process ifeval constructions,
// and downstream builds also failed to conditionalize content based on the MARIADB or MYSQL attributes that I previously added.

== Topologies

=== Standalone

tag::sup-topo-standalone-backupdoc[]
This is often acceptable, since the binary log can also be used as an incremental link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/backup-methods.html[backup].
end::sup-topo-standalone-backupdoc[]

=== HA

tag::sup-topo-ha[]
You can use a variety of https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-solutions-switch.html[solutions to provide redundancy] for {connector-name}.
Deploying redundant replica hosts makes it significantly easier to tolerate and almost immediately recover from problems and failures.
Because most HA {connector-name} clusters use GTIDs, replicas are able to track all of the changes that occur on any primary server.
end::sup-topo-ha[]

=== Multi-primary

tag::sup-topo-multi-primary[]
link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/mysql-cluster-replication-multi-source.html[Network Database (NDB) cluster replication] uses one or more {connector-name} replica nodes that each replicate from multiple primary servers.
Cluster replication provides a powerful way to aggregate the replication of multiple {connector-name} clusters.
This topology requires the use of GTIDs.
end::sup-topo-multi-primary[]


=== Snapshots

==== Snapshot default flows (global/table read locks): repeatable read semantics

tag::snapshots-default-workflow-repeatable-read-semantics[]
a|Start a transaction with link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/innodb-consistent-read.html[repeatable read semantics] to ensure that all subsequent reads within the transaction are done against the _consistent snapshot_. +
end::snapshots-default-workflow-repeatable-read-semantics[]


=== Change events

==== Event values: create, update, and delete events

// The value for the following region is intentionally null, because the content applies only to MariaDB

tag::create-event-values-table-source-entry[]

end::create-event-values-table-source-entry[]



=== Mapping data types

==== Basic types

// The value for the following region is intentionally null, because the content applies only to MariaDB

tag::basic-data-type-descriptions-float-m-d[]

end::basic-data-type-descriptions-float-m-d[]


==== Temporal types

// The value for the following region is intentionally null, because the content applies only to MariaDB

tag::temporal-data-type-timezone-conversions[]
end::temporal-data-type-timezone-conversions[]


=== Setting up the database


==== Enabling the binlog

tag::setting-up-the-db-enabling-binlog[]
[source,SQL]
----
// for MySQL 5.x
mysql> SELECT variable_value as "BINARY LOGGING STATUS (log-bin) ::"
FROM information_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name='log_bin';
// for MySQL 8.x
mysql> SELECT variable_value as "BINARY LOGGING STATUS (log-bin) ::"
FROM performance_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name='log_bin';
----
end::setting-up-the-db-enabling-binlog[]




==== Configuring session timeouts

tag::session-timeout-options-descriptions[]
For more information see the link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_interactive_timeout[MySQL documentation].
|`wait_timeout`
a|The number of seconds that the server waits for activity on a non-interactive connection before closing it.
For more information, see the link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_interactive_timeout[MySQL documentation].
end::session-timeout-options-descriptions[]



=== Configuration properties

// Boolean value for MySQL/MariaDB `schema-history-cfg-store-only-captured-dbs-ddl` config property
// Used in `ref-connector-configuration-database-history-properties.adoc`
// Long term, for each connector, we could create a catalog of these snippet values and store them in connector-specific attribute files.
// Then include those files in the headers of each connector's main file.

tag::schema-hist-prop-store-only-cap-db-ddl-boolean[]
|`true`
end::schema-hist-prop-store-only-cap-db-ddl-boolean[]



=== Behavior when things go wrong

* GTIDs, if used
