= MariaDB snippets used in properties descriptions

// This file is called from shared-mariadb-mysql.adoc to render content that is specific to one of the two databases.
// Using this approach because the Nebel tool that is used to prepare the downstream docs does not process ifeval constructions,
// and downstream builds also failed to conditionalize content based on the MARIADB or MYSQL attributes that I previously added.


== Topologies

=== Standalone

tag::sup-topo-standalone-backupdoc[]
This is often acceptable, since the binary log can also be used as an incremental link:https://mariadb.com/kb/en/backup-and-restore-overview/[backup].
end::sup-topo-standalone-backupdoc[]

=== High availability

tag::sup-topo-ha[]
A variety of link:https://mariadb.com/docs/server/architecture/use-cases/high-availability/[high availability] solutions exist for {connector-name}, and they make it significantly easier to tolerate and almost immediately recover from problems and failures.
Because HA {connector-name} clusters use GTIDs, replicas are able to track all of the changes that occur on any primary server.
end::sup-topo-ha[]

=== Multi-primary

tag::sup-topo-multi-primary[]
link:https://mariadb.com/kb/en/galera-cluster/[Galera cluster replication] uses one or more {connector-name} replica nodes that each replicate from multiple primary servers.
Cluster replication provides a powerful way to aggregate the replication of multiple {connector-name} clusters.
end::sup-topo-multi-primary[]

=== Snapshots

==== Snapshot default flows (global/table read locks): repeatable read semantics

tag::snapshots-default-workflow-repeatable-read-semantics[]
a|Start a transaction with link:https://mariadb.com/kb/en/set-transaction/#repeatable-read[repeatable read semantics] to ensure that all subsequent reads within the transaction are done against the _consistent snapshot_. +
end::snapshots-default-workflow-repeatable-read-semantics[]



=== Change events

==== Event values: create, update, and delete events


tag::create-event-values-table-source-entry[]
If the xref:enable-mariadb-binlog[`binlog_annotate_row_events`] option is enabled in the MariaDB database configuration, and you enable the `include.query` property in the connector configuration, the `source` field also provides a `query` field, which contains the original SQL statement that caused the change event.
end::create-event-values-table-source-entry[]



=== Mapping data types


==== Basic types

tag::basic-data-type-descriptions-float-m-d[]
|`FLOAT(M,D)`
|`FLOAT64`
a|_n/a_
end::basic-data-type-descriptions-float-m-d[]

==== Temporal types

tag::temporal-data-type-timezone-conversions[]
If this fails, it must be specified explicitly by the database `timezone` {connector-name} configuration option.
For example, if the databaseâ€™s time zone (either globally or configured for the connector by means of the `timezone` option) is "America/Los_Angeles", the TIMESTAMP value "2018-06-20 06:37:03" is represented by a `ZonedTimestamp` with the value "2018-06-20T13:37:03Z".
end::temporal-data-type-timezone-conversions[]




=== Setting up the database


==== Enabling the binlog

tag::setting-up-the-db-enabling-binlog[]
[source,SQL]
----
mariadb> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%log_bin%';
----
end::setting-up-the-db-enabling-binlog[]


==== Configuring session timeouts

tag::session-timeout-options-descriptions[]
For more information see the link:https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#interactive_timeout[MariaDB documentation].
|`wait_timeout`
a|The number of seconds that the server waits for activity on a non-interactive connection before closing it.
For more information, see the link:https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#wait_timeout[MariaDB documentation].
end::session-timeout-options-descriptions[]






=== Configuration properties

// Boolean value for MySQL/MariaDB `schema-history-cfg-store-only-captured-dbs-ddl` config property.
// Used in `ref-connector-configuration-database-history-properties.adoc`
// Long term, for each connector, we could create a catalog of these snippet values and store them in connector-specific attribute files.
// Then include those files in the headers of each connector's main file.

tag::schema-hist-prop-store-only-cap-db-ddl-boolean[]

`true`
end::schema-hist-prop-store-only-cap-db-ddl-boolean[]
