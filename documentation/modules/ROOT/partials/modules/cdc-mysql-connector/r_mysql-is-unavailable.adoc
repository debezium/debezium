= MySQL is unavailable

If your MySQL server becomes unavailable, the {prodname} MySQL connector fails with an error and the connector stops. You simply need to restart the connector when the server is available.

== Using GTIDs

If you have GTIDs enabled and a highly available MySQL cluster, restart the connector immediately as the connector will simply connect to a different MySQL server in the cluster, find the location in the server's binlog that represents the last transaction, and begin reading the new server's binlog from that specific location.

== Not Using GTIDs

If you do not have GTIDs enabled, the connector only records the binlog position of the MySQL server to which it was connected. In order to restart from the correct binlog position, you must reconnect to that specific server.
