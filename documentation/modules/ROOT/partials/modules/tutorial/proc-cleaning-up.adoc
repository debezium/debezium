After you are finished with the tutorial,
you can use Docker to stop all of the running containers.

.Procedure

. Stop each of the containers:
+
--
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
$ docker stop mysqlterm watcher connect mysql kafka
----

Docker stops each container.
Because you used the `--rm` option when you started them, Docker also removes them.

[NOTE]
====
If you use Podman, run the following command:
[source,shell,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ podman pod kill dbz
$ podman pod rm dbz
----
====
endif::community[]

. Verify that all of the processes have stopped and have been removed:
+
--
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
$ docker ps -a
----

If any of the processes are still running,
stop them using `docker stop __<process-name>__` or `docker stop __<containerId>__`.
