= Registering a connector to monitor the `inventory` database

By registering the {prodname} MySQL connector,
the connector will start monitoring the MySQL database server's `binlog`.
The `binlog` records all of the database's transactions (such as changes to individual rows and changes to the schemas).
When a row in the database changes,
{prodname} generates a change event.

[NOTE]
====
Typically, you would likely use the Kafka tools to manually create the necessary topics,
including specifying the number of replicas.
However, for this tutorial, Kafka is configured to automatically create the topics with just one replica.
====

.Procedure

. Review the configuration of the {prodname} MySQL connector that you will register.
+
--
Before registering the connector,
you should be familiar with its configuration.
In the next step,
you will register the following connector:

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  "name": "inventory-connector",  // <1>
  "config": {  // <2>
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",  // <3>
    "database.hostname": "mysql",  // <4>
    "database.port": "3306",
    "database.user": "debezium",
    "database.password": "dbz",
    "database.server.id": "184054",  // <5>
    "database.server.name": "dbserver1",  // <5>
    "database.include.list": "inventory",  // <6>
    "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "kafka:9092",  // <7>
    "database.history.kafka.topic": "schema-changes.inventory"  // <7>
  }
}
----
<1> The name of the connector.
<2> The connector's configuration.
<3> Only one task should operate at any one time.
Because the MySQL connector reads the MySQL server's `binlog`,
using a single connector task ensures proper order and event handling.
The Kafka Connect service uses connectors to start one or more tasks that do the work,
and it automatically distributes the running tasks across the cluster of Kafka Connect services.
If any of the services stop or crash, those tasks will be redistributed to running services.
<4> The database host,
which is the name of the Docker container running the MySQL server (`mysql`).
Docker manipulates the network stack within the containers so that each linked container can be resolved with `/etc/hosts` using the container name for the host name.
If MySQL were running on a normal network, you would specify the IP address or resolvable host name for this value.
<5> A unique server ID and name. The server name is the logical identifier for the MySQL server or cluster of servers.
This name will be used as the prefix for all Kafka topics.
<6> Only changes in the `inventory` database will be detected.
<7> The connector will store the history of the database schemas in Kafka using this broker (the same broker to which you are sending events) and topic name.
Upon restart, the connector will recover the schemas of the database that existed at the point in time in the `binlog` when the connector should begin reading.

For more information, see {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-connector-properties[MySQL connector configuration properties].

. Open a new terminal, and use the `curl` command to register the {prodname} MySQL connector.
+
--
This command uses the Kafka Connect service's API to submit a `POST` request against the `/connectors` resource with a JSON document that describes the new connector (called `inventory-connector`).

This command uses `localhost` to connect to the Docker host.
If you are using a non-native Docker platform,
replace `localhost` with the IP address of of your Docker host.

$ curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" localhost:8083/connectors/ -d '{ "name": "inventory-connector", "config": { "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector", "tasks.max": "1", "database.hostname": "mysql", "database.port": "3306", "database.user": "debezium", "database.password": "dbz", "database.server.id": "184054", "database.server.name": "dbserver1", "database.include.list": "inventory", "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "kafka:9092", "database.history.kafka.topic": "dbhistory.inventory" } }'

[NOTE]
====
Windows users may need to escape the double-quotes.
For example:

[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" localhost:8083/connectors/ -d '{ \"name\": \"inventory-connector\", \"config\": { \"connector.class\": \"io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector\", \"tasks.max\": \"1\", \"database.hostname\": \"mysql\", \"database.port\": \"3306\", \"database.user\": \"debezium\", \"database.password\": \"dbz\", \"database.server.id\": \"184054\", \"database.server.name\": \"dbserver1\", \"database.include.list\": \"inventory\", \"database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers\": \"kafka:9092\", \"database.history.kafka.topic\": \"dbhistory.inventory\" } }'
----

Otherwise, you might see an error like the following:

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{"error_code":500,"message":"Unexpected character ('n' (code 110)): was expecting double-quote to start field name\n at [Source: (org.glassfish.jersey.message.internal.ReaderInterceptorExecutor$UnCloseableInputStream); line: 1, column: 4]"}

For Podman use the below command
[source,shell,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" localhost:8083/connectors/ -d '{ "name": "inventory-connector", "config": { "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector", "tasks.max": "1", "database.hostname": "0.0.0.0", "database.port": "3306", "database.user": "debezium", "database.password": "dbz", "database.server.id": "184054", "database.server.name": "dbserver1", "database.include.list": "inventory", "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "0.0.0.0:9092", "database.history.kafka.topic": "dbhistory.inventory" } }'
----

. Verify that `inventory-connector` is included in the list of connectors:
+
--
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
$ curl -H "Accept:application/json" localhost:8083/connectors/
["inventory-connector"]
----
--

. Review the connector's tasks:
+
--
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
$ curl -i -X GET -H "Accept:application/json" localhost:8083/connectors/inventory-connector
----

You should see a response similar to the following (formatted for readability):

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  ...
  "tasks": [
    {
      "connector": "inventory-connector",  // <1>
      "task": 0
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> The connector is running a single task (task `0`) to do its work.
The connector only supports a single task,
because MySQL records all of its activities in one sequential `binlog`.
This means the connector only needs one reader to get a consistent, ordered view of all of the events.
