= Starting Kafka

After starting ZooKeeper, you can start Kafka in a new container.

ifdef::product[]
[NOTE]
====
{prodname} {debezium-version} requires Kafka Connect {debezium-kafka-version}.
Therefore, this procedure uses {debezium-kafka-version} of the Kafka broker.
For more information about compatibility between different versions of Kafka Connect and Kafka broker,
see the {link-kafka-docs}.html[Kafka documentation].

ifdef::community[]
[NOTE]
====
{prodname} {debezium-version} has been tested against multiple versions of Kafka Connect.
Please refer to the https://debezium.io/releases[Debezium Test Matrix] to determine compatibility between {prodname} and Kafka Connect.

.Procedure

. Open a new terminal and use it to start Kafka in a container.
+
--
This command runs a new container using version {debezium-docker-label} of the `debezium/kafka` image:

[source,shell,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ docker run -it --rm --name kafka -p 9092:9092 --link zookeeper:zookeeper debezium/kafka:{debezium-docker-label}
----

`-it`:: The container is interactive,
which means the terminal's standard input and output are attached to the container.
`--rm`:: The container will be removed when it is stopped.
`--name kafka`:: The name of the container.
`-p 9092:9092`:: Maps port `9092` in the container to the same port on the Docker host so that applications outside of the container can communicate with Kafka.
`--link zookeeper:zookeeper`:: Tells the container that it can find ZooKeeper in the `zookeeper` container,
which is running on the same Docker host.

[NOTE]
====
In this tutorial, you will always connect to Kafka from within a Docker container.
Any of these containers can communicate with the `kafka` container by linking to it.
If you needed to connect to Kafka from _outside_ of a Docker container,
you would have to set the `-e` option to advertise the Kafka address through the Docker host
(`-e ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=` followed by either the IP address or resolvable host name of the Docker host).
====

. Verify that Kafka started.

You should see output similar to the following:

[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
...
2017-09-21 07:16:59,085 - INFO  [main-EventThread:ZkClient@713] - zookeeper state changed (SyncConnected)
2017-09-21 07:16:59,218 - INFO  [main:Logging$class@70] - Cluster ID = LPtcBFxzRvOzDSXhc6AamA
...
2017-09-21 07:16:59,649 - INFO  [main:Logging$class@70] - [Kafka Server 1], started  // <1>
----
<1> The Kafka broker has successfully started and is ready for client connections. The terminal will continue to show additional output as Kafka generates it.
