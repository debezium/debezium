= MySQL supported topologies

The {prodname} MySQL connector supports the following MySQL topologies:

Standalone::
When a single MySQL server is used, the server must have the binlog enabled (_and optionally GTIDs enabled_) so the {prodname} MySQL connector can monitor the server. This is often acceptable, since the binary log can also be used as an incremental link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/backup-methods.html[backup]. In this case, the MySQL connector always connects to and follows this standalone MySQL server instance.

Primary and replica::
The {prodname} MySQL connector can follow one of the primary servers or one of the replicas (_if that replica has its binlog enabled_), but the connector only sees changes in the cluster that are visible to that server. Generally, this is not a problem except for the multi-primary topologies.
+
The connector records its position in the serverâ€™s binlog, which is different on each server in the cluster. Therefore, the connector will need to follow just one MySQL server instance. If that server fails, it must be restarted or recovered before the connector can continue.

High available clusters::
A variety of link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-ha-scalability/en/[high availability] solutions exist for MySQL, and they make it far easier to tolerate and almost immediately recover from problems and failures. Most HA MySQL clusters use GTIDs so that replicas are able to keep track of all changes on any of the primary servers.

Multi-primary::
A link: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/mysql-cluster-replication-multi-source.html[NDB Cluster Replication] uses one or more MySQL replica nodes that each replicate from multiple primary servers. This is a powerful way to aggregate the replication of multiple MySQL clusters, and requires using GTIDs.
+
The {prodname} MySQL connector can use these multi-primary MySQL replicas as sources, and can fail over to different multi-primary MySQL replicas as long as thew new replica is caught up to the old replica (_e.g., the new replica has all the transactions that were last seen on the first replica_). This works even if the connector is only using a subset of databases and/or tables, as the connector can be configured to include or exclude specific GTID sources when attempting to reconnect to a new multi-primary MySQL replica and find the correct position in the binlog.

Hosted::
There is support for the {prodname} MySQL connector to use hosted options such as Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora.
+
IMPORTANT: Because these hosted options do not allow a *global read lock*, table-level locks are used to create the _consistent snapshot_.
