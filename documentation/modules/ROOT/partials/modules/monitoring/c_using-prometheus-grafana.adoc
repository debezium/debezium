= Using Prometheus and Grafana

The metrics exposed by {prodname} and Kafka can be exported and displayed with https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] and https://grafana.com/[Grafana].
You can find an example for the required configuration and example dashboards for different connectors in the https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/monitoring[Debezium examples repository].

[NOTE]
====
These dashboards are not part of {prodname} itself and are maintained on a best-effort basis.
