.Procedure using kafka signaling channel

You can send a message to the {link-prefix}:{link-signalling}#debezium-signaling-enabling-kafka-signaling-channel[configured Kafka topic] to request the connector to run an ad hoc incremental snapshot.

The key of the Kafka message must match the value of the `topic.prefix` connector configuration option.

The value of the message is a JSON object with `type` and `data` fields.

The signal type is `execute-snapshot`, and the `data` field must have the following fields:

.Execute snapshot data fields
[cols="2,2,6",options="header"]
|===
|Field | Default | Value

|`type`
|`incremental`
| The type of the snapshot to be executed.
Currently {prodname} supports only the `incremental` type.  +
See the next section for more details.

|`data-collections`
|_N/A_
| An array of comma-separated regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to include in the snapshot. +
Specify the names by using the same format as is required for the xref:{context}-property-signal-data-collection[signal.data.collection] configuration option.

|`additional-condition`
|_N/A_
| An optional string that specifies a condition that the connector evaluates to designate a subset of columns to include in a snapshot.
|===

An example of the execute-snapshot Kafka message:

----
Key = `test_connector`

Value = `{"type":"execute-snapshot","data": {"data-collections": ["schema1.table1", "schema1.table2"], "type": "INCREMENTAL"}}`
----

==== Ad hoc incremental snapshots with additional-condition

{prodname} uses the `additional-condition` field to select a subset of a {data-collection}'s content.

Typically, when {prodname} runs a snapshot, it runs a SQL query such as:

`SELECT * FROM _<tableName>_ ....`

When the snapshot request includes an `additional-condition`, the `additional-condition` is appended to the SQL query, for example:

`SELECT * FROM _<tableName>_ WHERE _<additional-condition>_ ....`

For example, given a `products` {data-collection} with the columns `id` (primary key), `color`, and `brand`, if you want a snapshot to include only content for which `color='blue'`, when you request the snapshot, you could append an `additional-condition` statement to filter the content:
----
Key = `test_connector`

Value = `{"type":"execute-snapshot","data": {"data-collections": ["schema1.products"], "type": "INCREMENTAL", "additional-condition":"color='blue'"}}`
----

You can use the `additional-condition` statement to pass conditions based on multiple columns.
For example, using the same `products` {data-collection} as in the previous example, if you want a snapshot to include only the content from the `products` {data-collection} for which `color='blue'`, and `brand='MyBrand'`, you could send the following request:

----
Key = `test_connector`

Value = `{"type":"execute-snapshot","data": {"data-collections": ["schema1.products"], "type": "INCREMENTAL", "additional-condition":"color='blue' AND brand='MyBrand'"}}`
----
