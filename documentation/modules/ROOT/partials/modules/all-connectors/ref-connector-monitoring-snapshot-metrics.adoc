Snapshot metrics are not exposed unless a snapshot operation is active, or if a snapshot has occurred since the last connector start.

The following table lists the snapshot metrics that are available.

|Attributes |Type |Description

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-lastevent_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-lastevent_{context}, `LastEvent`>>
|`string`
|The last snapshot event that the connector has read.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-millisecondssincelastevent_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-millisecondssincelastevent_{context}, `MilliSecondsSinceLastEvent`>>
|`long`
|The number of milliseconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-totalnumberofeventsseen_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-totalnumberofeventsseen_{context}, `TotalNumberOfEventsSeen`>>
|`long`
|The total number of events that this connector has seen since last started or reset.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-numberofeventsfiltered_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-numberofeventsfiltered_{context}, `NumberOfEventsFiltered`>>
|`long`
| The number of events that have been filtered by include/exclude list filtering rules configured on the connector.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-capturedtables_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-capturedtables_{context}, `CapturedTables`>>
|`string[]`
|The list of tables that are captured by the connector.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-queuetotalcapacity_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-queuetotalcapacity_{context}, `QueueTotalCapacity`>>
|`int`
|The length the queue used to pass events between the snapshotter and the main Kafka Connect loop.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-queueremainingcapacity_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-queueremainingcapacity_{context}, `QueueRemainingCapacity`>>
|`int`
|The free capacity of the queue used to pass events between the snapshotter and the main Kafka Connect loop.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-totaltablecount_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-totaltablecount_{context}, `TotalTableCount`>>
|`int`
|The total number of tables that are being included in the snapshot.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-remainingtablecount_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-remainingtablecount_{context}, `RemainingTableCount`>>
|`int`
|The number of tables that the snapshot has yet to copy.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotrunning_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotrunning_{context}, `SnapshotRunning`>>
|`boolean`
|Whether the snapshot was started.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotpaused_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotpaused_{context}, `SnapshotPaused`>>
|`boolean`
|Whether the snapshot was paused.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotaborted_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotaborted_{context}, `SnapshotAborted`>>
|`boolean`
|Whether the snapshot was aborted.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotcompleted_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotcompleted_{context}, `SnapshotCompleted`>>
|`boolean`
|Whether the snapshot completed.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotdurationinseconds_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotdurationinseconds_{context}, `SnapshotDurationInSeconds`>>
|`long`
|The total number of seconds that the snapshot has taken so far, even if not complete. Includes also time when snapshot was paused.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotpauseddurationinseconds_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-snapshotpauseddurationinseconds_{context}, `SnapshotPausedDurationInSeconds`>>
|`long`
|The total number of seconds that the snapshot was paused. If the snapshot was paused several times, the paused time adds up.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-rowsscanned_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-rowsscanned_{context}, `RowsScanned`>>
|`Map<String, Long>`
|Map containing the number of rows scanned for each table in the snapshot.
Tables are incrementally added to the Map during processing.
Updates every 10,000 rows scanned and upon completing a table.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-maxqueuesizeinbytes_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-maxqueuesizeinbytes_{context}, `MaxQueueSizeInBytes`>>
|`long`
|The maximum buffer of the queue in bytes. This metric is available if xref:{context}-property-max-queue-size-in-bytes[`max.queue.size.in.bytes`] is set to a positive long value.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-currentqueuesizeinbytes_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-currentqueuesizeinbytes_{context}, `CurrentQueueSizeInBytes`>>
|`long`
|The current volume, in bytes, of records in the queue.
