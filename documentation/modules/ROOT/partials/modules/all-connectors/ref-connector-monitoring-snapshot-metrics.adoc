The *MBean* is `debezium.{mbean-name}:type=connector-metrics,context=snapshot,server=_<{context}.server.name>_`.

Snapshot metrics are not exposed unless a snapshot operation is active, or if a snapshot has occurred since the last connector start.

The following table lists the shapshot metrics that are available.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-queueremainingcapacity_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-queueremainingcapacity_{context}, `QueueRemainingCapacity`>>
|`int`
|The free capacity of the queue used to pass events between the snapshotter and the main Kafka Connect loop.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-totaltablecount_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-totaltablecount_{context}, `TotalTableCount`>>
|`int`
|The total number of tables that are being included in the snapshot.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-remainingtablecount_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-remainingtablecount_{context}, `RemainingTableCount`>>

|`Map<String, Long>`
|Map containing the number of rows scanned for each table in the snapshot.
Tables are incrementally added to the Map during processing.
Updates every 10,000 rows scanned and upon completing a table.

|[[connectors-snaps-metric-maxqueuesizeinbytes_{context}]]<<connectors-snaps-metric-maxqueuesizeinbytes_{context}, `MaxQueueSizeInBytes`>>
|`long`
