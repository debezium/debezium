The {prodname} connector provides for pass-through configuration of the database driver.
Pass-through database properties begin with the prefix `driver.*`.
For example, the connector passes properties such as `driver.foobar=false` to the JDBC URL.

{prodname} strips the prefixes from the properties before it passes the properties to the database driver.
