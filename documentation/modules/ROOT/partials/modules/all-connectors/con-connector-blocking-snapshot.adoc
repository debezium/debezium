To provide more flexibility in managing snapshots, {prodname} includes a supplementary ad hoc snapshot mechanism, known as _blocking snapshot_.
Blocking snapshots rely on the {prodname} mechanism for {link-prefix}:{link-signalling}#sending-signals-to-a-debezium-connector[sending signals to a {prodname} connector].

Blocking snapshot is similar to the _initial snapshot_ with the difference that you can trigger it at run time.

You can choose to use this type of snapshot over the standard initial snapshot process when:

* You need to run it at running time for adding a new {data-collection}.
* The {data-collection} you want to add is big and the performance of _incremental snapshotting_ does not fit your requirements.

.Blocking snapshot process
When you run a blocking snapshot, {prodname} stops the streaming and the start the same steps of the _initial snapshot_ to snapshot the {data-collection} you need.
After the snapshot completes, the streaming will be resumed.

Currently, you need to use the `snapshot.*` properties to configure the snapshot.

.Possible duplicates
Since there will be some delay from the time you trigger the snapshot sending the signal, to the time when the streaming will effectively stops and the snapshot starts,
can happen that after the snapshot completes the event streams emits some record that has been just snapshotted.
