|`long`
|The total number of update events processed by the connector since its last start or metrics reset.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-totalnumberofdeleteeventsseen_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-totalnumberofdeleteeventsseen_{context}, `TotalNumberOfDeleteEventsSeen`>>
|`long`
|The total number of delete events processed by the connector since its last start or metrics reset.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-numberofeventsfiltered_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-numberofeventsfiltered_{context}, `NumberOfEventsFiltered`>>
|`long`
|The number of events that have been filtered by include/exclude list filtering rules configured on the connector.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-capturedtables_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-capturedtables_{context}, `CapturedTables`>>
|`string[]`
|The list of tables that are captured by the connector.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-queuetotalcapacity_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-queuetotalcapacity_{context}, `QueueTotalCapacity`>>
|`int`
|The length the queue used to pass events between the streamer and the main Kafka Connect loop.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-queueremainingcapacity_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-queueremainingcapacity_{context}, `QueueRemainingCapacity`>>
|`int`
|The free capacity of the queue used to pass events between the streamer and the main Kafka Connect loop.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-connected_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-connected_{context}, `Connected`>>
|`boolean`
|Flag that denotes whether the connector is currently connected to the database server.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-millisecondsbehindsource_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-millisecondsbehindsource_{context}, `MilliSecondsBehindSource`>>
|`long`
|The number of milliseconds between the last change event's timestamp and the connector processing it.
The values will incorporate any differences between the clocks on the machines where the database server and the connector are running.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-numberofcommittedtransactions_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-numberofcommittedtransactions_{context}, `NumberOfCommittedTransactions`>>
|`long`
|The number of processed transactions that were committed.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-sourceeventposition_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-sourceeventposition_{context}, `SourceEventPosition`>>
|`Map<String, String>`
|The coordinates of the last received event.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-lasttransactionid_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-lasttransactionid_{context}, `LastTransactionId`>>
|`string`
|Transaction identifier of the last processed transaction.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-maxqueuesizeinbytes_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-maxqueuesizeinbytes_{context}, `MaxQueueSizeInBytes`>>
|`long`
|The maximum buffer of the queue in bytes. This metric is available if xref:{context}-property-max-queue-size-in-bytes[`max.queue.size.in.bytes`] is set to a positive long value.

|[[connectors-strm-metric-currentqueuesizeinbytes_{context}]]<<connectors-strm-metric-currentqueuesizeinbytes_{context}, `CurrentQueueSizeInBytes`>>
|`long`
|The current volume, in bytes, of records in the queue.

|Attribute |Type |Description

|[[binlog-filename]]<<binlog-filename,`+BinlogFilename+`>>
|`string`
|The name of the binlog file that the connector has most recently read.

|[[binlog-position]]<<binlog-position,`+BinlogPosition+`>>
|`long`
|The most recent position (in bytes) within the binlog that the connector has read.

|[[is-gtid-mode-enabled]]<<is-gtid-mode-enabled,`+IsGtidModeEnabled+`>>
|`boolean`
|Flag that denotes whether the connector is currently tracking GTIDs from {connector-name} server.

|[[gtid-set]]<<gtid-set,`+GtidSet+`>>
|`string`
|The string representation of the most recent GTID set processed by the connector when reading the binlog.

|[[number-of-skipped-events]]<<number-of-skipped-events,`+NumberOfSkippedEvents+`>>
|`long`
|The number of events that have been skipped by the {connector-name} connector. Typically events are skipped due to a malformed or unparseable event from {connector-name}'s binlog.

|[[number-of-disconnects]]<<number-of-disconnects,`+NumberOfDisconnects+`>>
|`long`
|The number of disconnects by the {connector-name} connector.

|[[number-of-rolled-back-transactions]]<<number-of-rolled-back-transactions,`+NumberOfRolledBackTransactions+`>>
|`long`
|The number of processed transactions that were rolled back and not streamed.

|[[number-of-not-well-formed-transactions]]<<number-of-not-well-formed-transactions,`+NumberOfNotWellFormedTransactions+`>>
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not conformed to the expected protocol of `BEGIN` + `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`. This value should be `0` under normal conditions.

|[[number-of-large-transactions]]<<number-of-large-transactions,`+NumberOfLargeTransactions+`>>
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not fit into the look-ahead buffer. For optimal performance, this value should be significantly smaller than `NumberOfCommittedTransactions` and `NumberOfRolledBackTransactions`.
