= Deploying the MySQL connector

After starting the {prodname} and MySQL services,
you are ready to deploy the {prodname} MySQL connector so that it can start monitoring the sample MySQL database (`inventory`).

At this point, you are running the {prodname} services,
a MySQL database server with a sample `inventory` database,
and the MySQL command line client that is connected to the database.
To deploy the MySQL connector,
you must:

* xref:registering-connector-monitor-inventory-database[Register the MySQL connector to monitor the `inventory` database]
+
After the connector is registered,
it will start monitoring the database server's `binlog` and it will generate change events for each row that changes.

* xref:watching-connector-start-up[Watch the MySQL connector start]
+
Reviewing the Kafka Connect log output as the connector starts helps you to better understand each task it must complete before it can start monitoring the `binlog`.
