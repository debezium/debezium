= Viewing change events

After deploying the {prodname} MySQL connector,
it starts monitoring the `inventory` database for data change events.

When you watched the connector start up,
you saw that events were written to the following topics with the `dbserver1` prefix (the name of the connector):

`dbserver1`::
The {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-schema-change-topic[schema change topic] to which all of the DDL statements are written.

`dbserver1.inventory.products`::
Captures change events for the `products` table in the `inventory` database.

`dbserver1.inventory.products_on_hand`::
Captures change events for the `products_on_hand` table in the `inventory` database.

`dbserver1.inventory.customers`::
Captures change events for the `customers` table in the `inventory` database.

`dbserver1.inventory.orders`::
Captures change events for the `orders` table in the `inventory` database.

For this tutorial, you will explore the `dbserver1.inventory.customers` topic.
In this topic, you will see different types of change events to see how the connector captured them:

* xref:viewing-create-event[Viewing a _create_ event]
* xref:updating-database-viewing-update-event[Updating the database and viewing the _update_ event]
* xref:deleting-record-database-viewing-delete-event[Deleting a record in the database and viewing the _delete_ event]
* xref:restarting-kafka-connect-service[Restarting Kafka Connect and changing the database]
