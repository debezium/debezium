= Enabling JMX in Docker

If you are running Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect in Docker containers,
enabling JMX requires several additional environment variables that are not typically needed when running on a local machine.
This is because the JVM requires the host name to which it will advertise itself to JMX clients.
Thus, {prodname}'s Docker images for Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect use several environment variables to enable and configure JMX.
Most of the environment variables are the same for all of the images,
but there are some minor differences.
