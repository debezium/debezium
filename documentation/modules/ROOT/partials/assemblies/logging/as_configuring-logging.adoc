= Configuring logging

By default, {prodname} connectors write all `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR` messages to the console.
However, you can change this configuration in the following ways:

* xref:changing-logging-level[Change the logging level]
* xref:adding-mapped-diagnostic-contexts[Add mapped diagnostic contexts]

[NOTE]
====
This section only covers a couple methods you can use to configure {prodname} logging with Log4j.
For more information about using Log4j,
search for tutorials to set up and use appenders to send log messages to specific destinations.
