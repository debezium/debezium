== Overview
endif::community[]

To improve performance and reduce storage overhead, databases can use external storage for certain columns.
This type of storage is used for columns that store large amounts of data, such as the PostgreSQL TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique), Oracle Large Object (LOB), or the Oracle Exadata Extended String data types.
To reduce I/O overhead and increase query speed, when data changes in a table row, the database retrieves only the columns that contain new values, ignoring data in externally stored columns that remains unchanged,   .
As a result, the value of the externally stored column is not recorded in the database log, and {prodname} subsequently omits the column when it emits the event record.
Downstream consumers that receive event records that omit required keys or values can experience processing errors.

To retrieve data for columns that were not available in the initial query, you can apply the {prodname} reselect columns post processor (`ReselectColumnsPostProcessor`).
You can configure the post processor to reselect one or more columns from a table.
After you configure the post processor, it monitors events that the connector emits for the column names that you designate for reselection.
When it detects an event with the specified columns, the post processor re-queries the source tables to retrieve data for the specified columns, and fetches their current state.

You can configure the post processor to reselect the following column types:

 * `null` columns.
 * Columns that contain the `unavailable.value.placeholder` sentinel value.


NOTE: You can use the `ReselectColumnsPostProcessor` post processor only with {prodname} SQL database connectors.

[id="keyless-tables"]
== Keyless tables

The reselect columns post processor generates a reselect query that returns the row to be modified.
To construct the `WHERE` clause for the query, by default, the post processor uses a relational table model that is based on the table's primary key columns or on the unique index that is defined for the table.

For keyless tables, the `SELECT` query that `ReselectColumnsPostProcessor` submits might return multiple rows, in which case {prodname} always uses only the first row.
You cannot prioritize the order of the returned rows.
To enable the post processor to return a consistently usable result for a keyless table, it's best to designate a custom key that can identify a unique row.
The custom key must be capable of uniquely identify records in the source table based on a combination of columns.

To define such a custom message key, use the `message.key.columns` property in the connector configuration.
After you define a custom key, set the xref:reselect-columns-post-processor-property-reselect-use-event-key[`reselect.use.event.key`] configuration property to `true`.
Setting this option enables the post processor to use the specified event key fields as selection criteria in lieu of a primary key column.
Be sure to test the configuration to ensure that the reselection query provides the expected results.

== Configuration example

Configuring a post processor is similar to configuring a {link-prefix}:{link-custom-converters}#developing-debezium-custom-data-type-converters[custom converter] or {link-prefix}:{link-transformations}#applying-transformations-to-modify-messages-exchanged-with-kafka[single message transformation (SMT)].
To enable the connector to use the `ReselectColumnsPostProcessor`, add the following entries to the connector configuration:

[source,json,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]

  "post.processors": "reselector", // <1>
  "reselector.type": "io.debezium.processors.reselect.ReselectColumnsPostProcessor", // <2>

== Configuration options

The following table lists the configuration options that you can set for the Reselect Columns post-processor.

Do not set this property if you set the `reselect.columns.exclude.list` property.

|No default
|Comma-separated list of column names in the source database to exclude from reselection.
Use the following format to specify column names: + `_<schema>_._<table>_:_<column>_` +

Do not set this property if you set the `reselect.columns.include.list` property.

|[[reselect-columns-post-processor-property-reselect-unavailable-values]]<<reselect-columns-post-processor-property-reselect-unavailable-values, `+reselect.unavailable.values+`>>
|`true`
|Specifies whether the post processor reselects a column that matches the `reselect.columns.include.list` filter if the column value is provided by the connector's `unavailable.value.placeholder` property.

|[[reselect-columns-post-processor-property-reselect-null-values]]<<reselect-columns-post-processor-property-reselect-null-values, `+reselect.null.values+`>>
|`true`
|Specifies whether the post processor reselects a column that matches the `reselect.columns.include.list` filter if the column value is `null`.

|[[reselect-columns-post-processor-property-reselect-use-event-key]]<<reselect-columns-post-processor-property-reselect-use-event-key, `+reselect.use.event.key+`>>
|`false`
|Specifies whether the post processor reselects based on the event's key field names or uses the relational table's primary key column names. +
 +
By default, the reselection query is based on the relational table's primary key columns or unique key index.
For tables that do not have a primary key, set this property to `true`, and configure the `message.key.columns` property in the connector configuration to specify a custom key for the connector to use when it creates events.
The post processor then uses the specified key field names as the primary key in the SQL reselection query.
