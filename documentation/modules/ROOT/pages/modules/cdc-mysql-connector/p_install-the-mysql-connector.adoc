= Installing the MySQL connector

Installing the {prodname} MySQL connector is a simple process whereby you only need to download the JAR, extract it to your Kafka Connect environment, and ensure the plugin's parent directory is specified in your Kafka Connect environment.

.Prerequisites

* You have link:https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Zookeeper], link:http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka], and link:http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] installed.
* You have MySQL Server installed and setup.

.Procedure

ifdef::cdc-product[]
. Download the {prodname} link:{mysql-connector-plugin-download}[MySQL connector plugin].
endif::cdc-product[]
ifndef::cdc-product[]
. Download the {prodname} link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-mysql/{debezium-version}/debezium-connector-mysql-{debezium-version}-plugin.tar.gz[MySQL connector plugin].
endif::cdc-product[]
. Extract the files into your Kafka Connect environment.
. Add the plugin's parent directory to your Kafka Connect plugin path:
[source]
----
plugin.path=/kafka/connect
----

NOTE: The above example assumes you have extracted the {prodname} MySQL connector to the `/kafka/connect/{prodname}-connector-mysql` path.

[start=4]
. Restart your Kafka Connect process. This ensures the new JARs are picked up.
