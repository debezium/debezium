= MySQL connector events

All data change events produced by the {prodname} MySQL connector contain a key and a value. The change event key and the change event value each contain a _schema_ and a _payload_ where the schema describes the structure of the payload and the payload contains the data.

WARNING: The MySQL connector ensures that all Kakfa Connect schema names adhere to the link:http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#names[Avro schema name format]. This is important as any character that is not a latin letter or underscore is replaced by an underscore which can lead to unexpected conflicts in schema names when the logical server names, database names, and table names container other characters that are replaced with these underscores.
