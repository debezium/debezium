= MySQL connector events

All data change events produced by the {prodname} MySQL connector contain a key and a value. The change event key and the change event value each contain a _schema_ and a _payload_ where the schema describes the structure of the payload and the payload contains the data.

WARNING: The MySQL connector ensures that all Kakfa Connect schema names adhere to the link:http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#names[Avro schema name format]. This is important as any character that is not a latin letter or underscore is replaced by an underscore which can lead to unexpected conflicts in schema names when the logical server names, database names, and table names container other characters that are replaced with these underscores.

== Change event key 

For any given table, the change event's key has a structure that contains a field for each column in the `PRIMARY KEY` (or unique constraint) at the time the event was created. Let us look at an example table and then how the schema and payload would look for the table.

.example table
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY
) AUTO_INCREMENT=1001;
