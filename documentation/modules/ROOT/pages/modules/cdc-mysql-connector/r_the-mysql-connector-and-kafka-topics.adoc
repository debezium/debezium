= The MySQL connector and Kafka topics

The {prodname} MySQL connector writes events for all `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations from a single table to a single Kafka topic. The Kafka topic naming convention is as follows:

.format 
[source,properties]
----
serverName.databaseName.tableName
----

.example
========
Let us say that `fulfillment` is the server name and `inventory` is the database which contains *three* tables of `orders`, `customers`, and `products`. The {prodname} MySQL connector produces events on three Kafka topics, one for each table in the database:


[source,properties]
----
fulfillment.inventory.orders

fulfillment.inventory.customers

fulfillment.inventory.products
----
========
