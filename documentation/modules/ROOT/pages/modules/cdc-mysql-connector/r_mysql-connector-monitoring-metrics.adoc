= MySQL connector monitoring metrics

The {prodname} MySQL connector has three metric types in addition to the built-in support for JMX metrics that Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect have.

* <<mysql-connector-snapshot-metrics, snapshot metrics>>; for monitoring the connector when performing snapshots
* <<mysql-connector-binlog-metrics, binlog metrics>>; for monitoring the connector when reading CDC table data
* <<mysql-connector-schema-history-metrics, schema history metrics>>; for monitoring the status of the connector's schema history

Please refer to the xref:operations/monitoring.adoc[monitoring documentation] for details of how to expose these metrics via JMX.

== Snapshot metrics
[[mysql-connector-snapshot-metrics]]

The *MBean* is `debezium.mysql:type=connector-metrics,context=snapshot,server=<database.server.name>`.

include::../../modules/cdc-all-connectors/r_connector-monitoring-snapshot-metrics.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The {prodname} MySQL connector also provides the following custom snapshot metrics:

[cols="3,2,5"]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Description

|`HoldingGlobalLock`
|`boolean`
|Whether the connector currently holds a global or table write lock.

|===


== Binlog metrics
[[mysql-connector-binlog-metrics]]

The *MBean* is `debezium.mysql:type=connector-metrics,context=binlog,server=<database.server.name>`.

NOTE: The transaction-related attributes are only available if binlog event buffering is enabled. See xref:assemblies/cdc-mysql-connector/as_deploy-the-mysql-connector.adoc#mysql-connector-configuration-properties_{context}[binlog.buffer.size] in the advanced connector configuration properties for more details.

include::../../modules/cdc-all-connectors/r_connector-monitoring-streaming-metrics.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The {prodname} MySQL connector also provides the following custom binlog metrics:

[cols="3,2,5"]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Description

|`BinlogFilename`
|`string`
|The name of the binlog filename that the connector has most recently read.

|`BinlogPosition`
|`long`
|The most recent position (in bytes) within the binlog that the connector has read.

|`IsGtidModeEnabled`
|`boolean`
|Flag that denotes whether the connector is currently tracking GTIDs from MySQL server.

|`GtidSet`
|`string`
|The string representation of the most recent GTID set seen by the connector when reading the binlog.

|`SecondsSinceLastEvent` (obsolete)
|`long`
|The number of seconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event.

|`SecondsBehindMaster` (obsolete)
|`long`
|The number of seconds between the last event's MySQL timestamp and the connector processing it. The values will incorporate any differences between the clocks on the machines where the MySQL server and the MySQL connector are running.

|`NumberOfSkippedEvents`
|`long`
|The number of events that have been skipped by the MySQL connector.  Typically events are skipped due to a malformed or unparseable event from MySQL's binlog.

|`NumberOfDisconnects`
|`long`
|The number of disconnects by the MySQL connector.

|`NumberOfRolledBackTransactions`
|`long`
|The number of processed transactions that were rolled back and not streamed.

|`NumberOfNotWellFormedTransactions`
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not conformed to expected protocol `BEGIN` + `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`. Should be `0` under normal conditions.

|`NumberOfLargeTransactions`
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not fitted into the look-ahead buffer. Should be significantly smaller than `NumberOfCommittedTransactions` and `NumberOfRolledBackTransactions` for optimal performance.

|===

== Schema history metrics
[[mysql-connector-schema-history-metrics]]

The *MBean* is `debezium.mysql:type=connector-metrics,context=schema-history,server=<database.server.name>`.

include::../../modules/cdc-all-connectors/r_connector-monitoring-schema-history-metrics.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
