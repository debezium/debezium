= MySQL connector monitoring metrics

The {prodname} MySQL connector has three metric types in addition to the built-in support for JMX metrics that Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect have.

* <<mysql-connector-snapshot-metrics, snapshot metrics>>
* <<mysql-connector-binlog-metrics, binlog metrics>>
* <<mysql-connector-schema-history-metrics, schema history metrics>>

== Snapshot metrics
[[mysql-connector-snapshot-metrics]]

The *MBean* is `debezium.mysql:type=connector-metrics,context=snapshot,server=<database.server.name>`.

[cols="3,1,6"]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Description

|`TotalTableCount`
|`int`
|The total number of tables that are being included in the snapshot.

|`RemainingTableCount`
|`int`
|The number of tables that the snapshot has yet to copy.

|`HoldingGlobalLock`
|`boolean`
|Whether the connector currently holds a global or table write lock.

|`SnapshotRunning`
|`boolean`
|Whether the snapshot was started.

|`SnapshotAborted`
|`boolean`
|Whether the snapshot was aborted.

|`SnapshotCompleted`
|`boolean`
|Whether the snapshot completed.

|`SnapshotDurationInSeconds`
|`long`
|The total number of seconds that the snapshot has taken so far, even if not complete.

|`RowsScanned`
|`Map<String, Long>`
|Map containing the number of rows scanned for each table in the snapshot. Tables are incrementally added to the Map during processing. Updates every 10,000 rows scanned and upon completing a table.

|`LastEvent`
|`string`
|The last snapshot event that the connector has read.

|`MilliSecondsSinceLastEvent`
|`long`
|The number of milliseconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event.

|`TotalNumberOfEventsSeen`
|`long`
|The total number of events that this connector has seen since last started or reset.

|`NumberOfEventsFiltered`
|`long`
|The number of events that have been filtered by whitelist or blacklist filtering rules configured on the connector.

|`MonitoredTables`
|`string[]`
|The list of tables that are monitored by the connector.

|`QueueTotalCapcity`
|`int`
|The length of the queue used to pass events between snapshot reader and the main Kafka Connect loop.

|`QueueRemainingCapcity`
|`int`
|The free capacity of the queue used to pass events between snapshot reader and the main Kafka Connect loop.

== Binlog metrics
[[mysql-connector-binlog-metrics]]

The *MBean* is `debezium.mysql:type=connector-metrics,context=binlog,server=<database.server.name>`.

NOTE: The transaction-related attributes are only available if binlog event buffering is enabled. See xref:assemblies/cdc-mysql-connector/as_deploy-the-mysql-connector.adoc#mysql-connector-configuration-properties_{context}[binlog.buffer.size] in the advanced connector configuration properties for more details.

[cols="3,1,6"]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Description

|`Connected`
|`boolean`
|Flag that denotes whether the connector is currently connected to the MySQL server.

|`BinlogFilename`
|`string`
|The name of the binlog filename that the connector has most recently read.

|`BinlogPosition`
|`long`
|The most recent position (in bytes) within the binlog that the connector has read.

|`IsGtidModeEnabled`
|`boolean`
|Flag that denotes whether the connector is currently tracking GTIDs from MySQL server.

|`GtidSet`
|`string`
|The string representation of the most recent GTID set seen by the connector when reading the binlog.

|`LastEvent`
|`string`
|The last binlog event that the connector has read.

|`SecondsSinceLastEvent` (obsolete)
|`long`
|The number of seconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event.

|`SecondsBehindMaster` (obsolete)
|`long`
|The number of seconds between the last event's MySQL timestamp and the connector processing it. The values will incorporate any differences between the clocks on the machines where the MySQL server and the MySQL connector are running.

|`MilliSecondsBehindSource`
|`long`
|The number of milliseconds between the last event's MySQL timestamp and the connector processing it. The values will incorporate any differences between the clocks on the machines where the MySQL server and the MySQL connector are running.

|`TotalNumberOfEventsSeen`
|`long`
|The total number of events that this connector has seen since last started or reset.

|`NumberOfSkippedEvents`
|`long`
|The number of events that have been skipped by the MySQL connector.  Typically events are skipped due to a malformed or unparseable event from MySQL's binlog.

|`NumberOfEventsFiltered`
|`long`
|The number of events that have been filtered by whitelist or blacklist filtering rules configured on the connector.

|`NumberOfDisconnects`
|`long`
|The number of disconnects by the MySQL connector.

|`SourceEventPosition`
|`map<string, string>`
|The coordinates of the last received event.

|`LastTransactionId`
|`string`
|Transaction identifier of the last processed transaction.

|`LastEvent`
|`string`
|The last binlog event that the connector has read.

|`MilliSecondsSinceLastEvent`
|`long`
|The number of milliseconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event.

|`MonitoredTables`
|`string[]`
|The list of tables that are monitored by {prodname}.

|`QueueTotalCapcity`
|`int`
|The length of the queue used to pass events between binlog reader and the main Kafka Connect loop.

|`QueueRemainingCapcity`
|`int`
|The free capacity of the queue used to pass events between binlog reader and the main Kafka Connect loop.

|`NumberOfCommittedTransactions`
|`long`
|The number of processed transactions that were committed.

|`NumberOfRolledBackTransactions`
|`long`
|The number of processed transactions that were rolled back and not streamed.

|`NumberOfNotWellFormedTransactions`
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not conformed to expected protocol `BEGIN` + `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`. Should be `0` under normal conditions.

|`NumberOfLargeTransactions`
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not fitted into the look-ahead buffer. Should be significantly smaller than `NumberOfCommittedTransactions` and `NumberOfRolledBackTransactions` for optimal performance.
