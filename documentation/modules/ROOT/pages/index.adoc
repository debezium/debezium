= Debezium Documentation


== What is it?

Debezium is a set of distributed services to capture changes in your databases so that your applications can see those changes and respond to them.
Debezium records all row-level changes within each database table in a _change event stream_, and applications simply read these streams to see the change events in the same order in which they occurred.


Use the links at the left to find the documentation for Debezium, including the various Debezium xref:connectors/index.adoc[connectors].
If you're trying to get your head around what Debezium is or how it works, we recommend starting with our xref:tutorial.adoc[tutorial] and link:https://www.infoq.com/presentations/data-streaming-kafka-debezium/[this session] from QCon San Francisco on CDC use cases with Debezium.
