[NOTE]
====
This single message transformation (SMT) is under active development right now, so the emitted message structure or other details may still change as development progresses.
====

[NOTE]
====
This SMT does *not* support the MongoDB connector.
====

The Outbox Event Router SMT has the intent to provide out-of-the-box support for the Outbox Pattern.
For more information on why and how the Outbox Pattern is used please refer our blog post link:/blog/2019/02/19/reliable-microservices-data-exchange-with-the-outbox-pattern/[Reliable Microservices Data Exchange With the Outbox Pattern].

For more implementation details please refer to the {jira-url}/browse/DBZ-1169[Outbox SMT Design].

A working example can also be found at our https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples[Examples Repository] in the https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/outbox[`outbox` directory].

== Example

In order to understand the configuration and terms used in this SMT, let's look into its parts with the given expected outbox message:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
# Kafka Topic: outbox.event.order
# Kafka Message key: "1"
# Kafka Message Headers: "id=4d47e190-0402-4048-bc2c-89dd54343cdc"
# Kafka Message Timestamp: 1556890294484
{
  "{\"id\": 1, \"lineItems\": [{\"id\": 1, \"item\": \"Debezium in Action\", \"status\": \"ENTERED\", \"quantity\": 2, \"totalPrice\": 39.98}, {\"id\": 2, \"item\": \"Debezium for Dummies\", \"status\": \"ENTERED\", \"quantity\": 1, \"totalPrice\": 29.99}], \"orderDate\": \"2019-01-31T12:13:01\", \"customerId\": 123}"
}
----

This message is generated by transforming a Debezium raw message, which looks like:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
# Kafka Message key: "406c07f3-26f0-4eea-a50c-109940064b8f"
# Kafka Message Headers: ""
# Kafka Message Timestamp: 1556890294484
{
  "before": null,
  "after": {
    "id": "406c07f3-26f0-4eea-a50c-109940064b8f",
    "aggregateid": "1",
    "aggregatetype": "Order",
    "payload": "{\"id\": 1, \"lineItems\": [{\"id\": 1, \"item\": \"Debezium in Action\", \"status\": \"ENTERED\", \"quantity\": 2, \"totalPrice\": 39.98}, {\"id\": 2, \"item\": \"Debezium for Dummies\", \"status\": \"ENTERED\", \"quantity\": 1, \"totalPrice\": 29.99}], \"orderDate\": \"2019-01-31T12:13:01\", \"customerId\": 123}",
    "timestamp": 1556890294344,
    "type": "OrderCreated"
  },
  "source": {
    "version": "0.9.3.Final",
    "connector": "postgresql",
    "name": "dbserver1-bare",
    "db": "orderdb",
    "ts_usec": 1556890294448870,
    "txId": 584,
    "lsn": 24064704,
    "schema": "inventory",
    "table": "outboxevent",
    "snapshot": false,
    "last_snapshot_record": null,
    "xmin": null
  },
  "op": "c",
  "ts_ms": 1556890294484
}

This result was achieved with the {link-prefix}:{link-outbox-event-router}#outbox-event-router-configuration-options[default configuration] which assumes a table structure and event routing based on aggregates. In case you want a custom behavior, the SMT is fully configurable, check the {link-prefix}:{link-outbox-event-router}#outbox-event-router-configuration-options[available configuration options].

=== Default configuration values explained

After observing all those pieces we can see what the default configuration does:

[cols="30%a,70%a",options="header"]
|=======================
|Table Column
|Effect

|`id`
|The `id` shows up as a header in the Kafka message, this is the unique ID of the event, can be used for consumer side dedupe for instance.

|`aggregatetype`
|Is the default field for the routing, it gets append to the topic name (check configuration <<outbox-event-router-property-route-topic-replacement, `route.topic.replacement`>>)

|`aggregateid`
|Becomes the Kafka message key, which is important for keeping ordering within Kafka partitions

|`payload`
|The JSON representation of the event itself, becomes either part of the message as `payload` or if other metadata including `eventType` are delivered as headers then the payload becomes the message itself without an encapsulation in an envelope
|=======================


=== Basic configuration

[source]
----
transforms=outbox,...
transforms.outbox.type=io.debezium.transforms.outbox.EventRouter
----

=== Using Avro as the payload format

The outbox routing SMT supports arbitrary payload formats, as the payload column value is passed on transparently.
As an alternative to working with JSON as shown above it's therefore also possible to use Avro.
This can be beneficial for the purposes of message format governance and making sure outbox event schemas evolve in a backwards-compatible way.

How a source application produces Avro messages as an outbox event payload is out of the scope of this documentation.
One possibility could be to leverage the `KafkaAvroSerializer` class and use it to serialize `GenericRecord` instances.
In order to ensure that the Kafka message value is the exact Avro binary data,
apply the following configuration to the connector:

[source]
----
transforms=outbox,...
transforms.outbox.type=io.debezium.transforms.outbox.EventRouter
value.converter=io.debezium.converters.ByteBufferConverter
----

By default only the `payload` column value (the Avro data) is the sole message value.
Using `ByteBufferConverter` as the value converter propagates that value as-is into the Kafka message value.

[[emitting-messages-with-additional-fields]]
=== Emitting messages with additional fields

The outbox table may contain additional columns that need to be included in the emitted Kafka message.
Suppose the table contains an `eventType` column that indicates the type a given event is (e.g. for events of the "purchase order" aggregate type, there might be event types like "order created", "order shipped", etc.).

To emit the `eventType` column in the Kafka message headers, use:

[source]
----
transforms=outbox,...
transforms.outbox.type=io.debezium.transforms.outbox.EventRouter
transforms.outbox.table.fields.additional.placement=type:header:eventType
----

To emit the `eventType` column in the Kafka message envelope, use:

[source]
----
transforms=outbox,...
transforms.outbox.type=io.debezium.transforms.outbox.EventRouter
transforms.outbox.table.fields.additional.placement=type:envelope:eventType
----
