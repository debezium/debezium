= Extracting source record `after` state from {prodname} change events
endif::product[]

A {prodname} data change event has a complex structure that provides a wealth of information. Kafka records that convey {prodname} change events contain all of this information. 
However, parts of a Kafka ecosystem might expect Kafka records that provide a flat structure of field names and values. 
To provide this kind of record, {prodname} provides the `ExtractNewRecordState` single message transformation (SMT). Configure this transformation when consumers need Kafka records that have a format that is simpler than Kafka records that contain {prodname} change events. 

The `ExtractNewRecordState` transformation is a 
link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_transforms[Kafka Connect SMT].

ifdef::product[]
The transformation is available to only SQL database connectors.

== Description of {prodname} change event structure
endif::product[]

ifdef::community[]
== Change event structure
endif::community[]

{prodname} generates data change events that have a complex structure.
Each event consists of three parts:

* Metadata, which includes but is not limited to:

** The operation that made the change 
** Source information such as the names of the database and table where the change was made
** Time stamp for when the change was made
** Optional transaction information

* Row data before the change
* Row data after the change

For example, the structure of an `UPDATE` change event looks like this:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
	"op": "u",
	"source": {
		...
	},
	"ts_ms" : "...",
	"before" : {
		"field1" : "oldvalue1",
		"field2" : "oldvalue2"
	},
	"after" : {
		"field1" : "newvalue1",
		"field2" : "newvalue2"
	}
}
----

ifdef::community[]
More details about change event structure are provided in 
xref:connectors/index.adoc[the documentation for each connector].
endif::community[]

This complex format provides the most information about changes happening in the system.
However, other connectors or other parts of the Kafka ecosystem usually expect the data in a simple format like this: 

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
	"field1" : "newvalue1",
	"field2" : "newvalue2"
}
----

To provide the needed Kafka record format for consumers, configure the `ExtractNewRecordState` SMT.

endif::community[]

ifdef::product[]
// Type: concept
[id="behavior-of-debezium-extractnewrecordstate-transformation"]
== Behavior of {prodname} `ExtractNewRecordState` transformation
endif::product[]

The `ExtractNewRecordState` SMT extracts the `after` field from a {prodname} change event in a Kafka record. The SMT replaces the original change event with only its `after` field to create a simple Kafka record. 

You can configure the `ExtractNewRecordState` SMT for a {prodname} connector or for a sink connector that consumes messages emitted by a {prodname} connector. The advantage of configuring `ExtractNewRecordState` for a sink connector is that records stored in Apache Kafka contain whole {prodname} change events. The decision to apply the SMT to a source or sink connector depends on your particular use case. 

You can configure the transformation to do any of the following: 

* Add metadata from the change event to the simplified Kafka record. The default behavior is that the SMT does not add metadata.

* Keep Kafka records that contain change events for `DELETE` operations in the stream. The default behavior is that the SMT drops Kafka records for `DELETE` operation change events because most consumers cannot yet handle them. 

A database `DELETE` operation causes {prodname} to generate two Kafka records: 

* A record that contains `"op": "d",` the `before` row data, and some other fields.
* A tombstone record that has the same key as the deleted row and a value of `null`. This record is a marker for Apache Kafka. It indicates that 
link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#compaction[log compaction] can remove all records that have this key. 

Instead of dropping the record that contains the `before` row data, you can configure the `ExtractNewRecordData` SMT to do one of the following: 

* Keep the record in the stream and edit it to have only the `"value": "null"` field.
 
* Keep the record in the stream and edit it to have a `value` field that contains the key/value pairs that were in the `before` field with an added `"__deleted": "true"` entry.

Similary, instead of dropping the tombstone record, you can configure the `ExtractNewRecordData` SMT to keep the tombstone record in the stream.

== Configuration of `ExtractNewRecordState` transformation
endif::product[]

Configure the {prodname} `ExtractNewRecordState` SMT in a Kafka Connect source or sink connector by adding the SMT configuration details to your connector's configuration. To obtain the default behavior, in a `.properties` file, you would specify something like the following: 

[source]
----
transforms=unwrap,...
transforms.unwrap.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState
----

As for any Kafka Connect connector configuration, you can set `transforms=` to multiple, comma-separated, SMT aliases in the order in which you want Kafka Connect to apply the SMTs. 

The following `.properties` example sets several `ExtractNewRecordState` options: 

[source]
----
transforms=unwrap,...
transforms.unwrap.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState
transforms.unwrap.drop.tombstones=false
transforms.unwrap.delete.handling.mode=rewrite
transforms.unwrap.add.fields=table,lsn
----

`drop.tombstones=false`:: Keeps tombstone records for `DELETE` operations in the event stream. 

`delete.handling.mode=rewrite`:: For `DELETE` operations, edits the Kafka record by flattening the `value` field that was in the change event. The `value` field directly contains the key/value pairs that were in the `before` field. The SMT adds `__deleted` and sets it to `true`, for example:   
+
[source,json,indent=0]
----
"value": {
  "pk": 2,
  "cola": null,
  "__deleted": "true"
}
----

`add.fields=table,lsn`:: Adds change event metadata for the `table` and `lsn` fields to the simplified Kafka record.

ifdef::product[]
// Type: concept
[id="example-of-adding-metadata-to-the-kafka-record"]
== Example of adding metadata to the Kafka record
endif::product[]

The `ExtractNewRecordState` SMT can add original, change event metadata to the simplified Kafka record. For example, you might want the simplified record's header or value to contain any of the following: 

* The type of operation that made the change
* The name of the database or table that was changed
* Connector-specific fields such as the Postgres LSN field

ifdef::community[]
For more information on what is available see xref:connectors/index.adoc[the documentation for each connector].
endif::community[]

To add metadata to the simplified Kafka record's header, specify the `add.header` option. 
To add metadata to the simplified Kafka record's value, specify the `add.fields` option. 
Each of these options takes a comma separated list of change event field names. Do not specify spaces. When there are duplicate field names, to add metadata for one of those fields, specify the struct as well as the field. For example:

----
transforms=unwrap,...
transforms.unwrap.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState
transforms.unwrap.add.fields=op,table,lsn,source.ts_ms
transforms.unwrap.add.headers=db
transforms.unwrap.delete.handling.mode=rewrite
----

With that configuration, a simplified Kafka record would contain something like the following: 

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{ 
 ...
	"__op" : "c", 
	"__table": "MY_TABLE", 
	"__lsn": "123456789", 
	"__source_ts_ms" : "123456789", 
 ...
}
----

Also, simplified Kafka records would have a `__db` header. 

In the simplified Kafka record, the SMT prefixes the metadata field names with a double underscore. When you specify a struct, the SMT also inserts an underscore between the struct name and the field name. 

To add metadata to a simplified Kafka record that is for a `DELETE` operation, you must also configure `delete.handling.mode=rewrite`.

The following table describes the options that you can specify for the `ExtractNewRecordState` SMT. 

[cols="30%a,25%a,45%a"]
|===
|Property
|Default
|Description

[id="extract-new-record-state-drop-tombstones"]
|{link-prefix}:{link-event-flattening}#extract-new-record-state-drop-tombstones[`drop.tombstones`]
|`true`
|{prodname} generates a tombstone record for each `DELETE` operation. The default behavior is that `ExtractNewRecordState` removes tombstone records from the stream. To keep tombstone records in the stream, specify `drop.tombstones=false`.  

[id="extract-new-record-state-delete-handling-mode"]
|{link-prefix}:{link-event-flattening}#extract-new-record-state-delete-handling-mode[`delete.handling.mode`]
|`drop`
|{prodname} generates a change event record for each `DELETE` operation. The default behavior is that `ExtractNewRecordState` removes these records from the stream. To keep Kafka records for `DELETE` operations in the stream, set `delete.handling.mode` to `none` or `rewrite`. +
 +
Specify `none` to keep the change event record in the stream. The record contains only `"value": "null"`.  + 
 +
Specify `rewrite` to keep the change event record in the stream and edit the record to have a `value` field that contains the key/value pairs that were in the `before` field and also add `+__deleted: true+` to the `value`. This is another way to indicate that the record has been deleted. +
 +
When you  specify `rewrite`, the updated simplified records for `DELETE` operations might be all you need to track deleted records. You can consider accepting the default behavior of dropping the tombstone records that the {prodname} connector creates.

[id="extract-new-record-state-route-by-field"]
|{link-prefix}:{link-event-flattening}#extract-new-record-state-route-by-field[`route.by.field`]
|
|To use row data to determine the topic to route the record to, set this option to an `after` field attribute. The SMT routes the record to the topic whose name matches the value of the specified `after` field attribute. For a `DELETE` operation, set this option to a `before` field attribute. +
 +
For example, configuration of `route.by.field=destination` routes records to the topic whose name is the value of `after.destination`. The default behavior is that a {prodname} connector sends each change event record to a topic whose name is formed from the name of the database and the name of the table in which the change was made. + 
 +
If you are configuring the `ExtractNewRecordState` SMT on a sink connector, setting this option might be useful when the destination topic name dictates the name of the database table that will be updated with the simplified change event record. If the topic name is not correct for your use case, you can configure `route.by.field` to re-route the event.

[id="extract-new-record-state-add-fields-prefix"]
|{link-prefix}:{link-event-flattening}#extract-new-record-state-add-fields-prefix[`add.fields.prefix`]
| __ (double-underscore)
|Set this optional string to prefix a field.

[id="extract-new-record-state-add-fields"]
|{link-prefix}:{link-event-flattening}#extract-new-record-state-add-fields[`add.fields`]
|
|Set this option to a comma-separated list, with no spaces, of metadata fields to add to the simplified Kafka record's value. When there are duplicate field names, to add metadata for one of those fields, specify the struct as well as the field, for example `source.ts_ms`. +
 +
When the SMT adds metadata fields to the simplified record's value, it prefixes each metadata field name with a double underscore. For a struct specification, the SMT also inserts an underscore between the struct name and the field name. +
 +
If you specify a field that is not in the change event record, the SMT still adds the field to the record's value.

[id="extract-new-record-state-add-headers-prefix"]
|{link-prefix}:{link-event-flattening}#extract-new-record-state-add-headers-prefix[`add.headers.prefix`]
| __ (double-underscore)
|Set this optional string to prefix a header.

[id="extract-new-record-state-add-headers"]
|{link-prefix}:{link-event-flattening}#extract-new-record-state-add-headers[`add.headers`]
|
|Set this option to a comma-separated list, with no spaces, of metadata fields to add to the header of the simplified Kafka record. When there are duplicate field names, to add metadata for one of those fields, specify the struct as well as the field, for example `source.ts_ms`. +
 +
When the SMT adds metadata fields to the simplified record's header, it prefixes each metadata field name with a double underscore. For a struct specification, the SMT also inserts an underscore between the struct name and the field name. +
 +
If you specify a field that is not in the change event record, the SMT does not add the field to the header.
