= Source Connectors

{prodname} provides a growing library of source connectors that capture changes from a variety of database management systems.
Each connector produces change events with very similar structures, making it easy for your applications to consume and respond to events, regardless of their origin.

We currently have the following connectors:

* xref:connectors/mongodb.adoc[MongoDB]
* xref:connectors/mysql.adoc[MySQL]
* xref:connectors/postgresql.adoc[PostgreSQL]
* xref:connectors/sqlserver.adoc[SQL Server]
* xref:connectors/oracle.adoc[Oracle]
* xref:connectors/db2.adoc[Db2]

* xref:connectors/vitess.adoc[Vitess] (Incubating)
* xref:connectors/spanner.adoc[Spanner]
* xref:connectors/informix.adoc[Informix] (Incubating)
