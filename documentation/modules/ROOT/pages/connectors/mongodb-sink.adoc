// ModuleID: overview-of-debezium-mongodb-sink-connector
[[mongodb-sink-overview]]
== Overview

The {prodname} MongoDB sink connector captures change event records from Apache Kafka topics and then transforms the records into MongoDB documents that it writes to a collections in a specified MongoDB sink database.
The connector processes only change events that originate from a {prodname} relational database connector.

// Type: concept
// Title: Architecture of the {prodname} MongoDB sink connector
// ModuleID: architecture-of-debezium-mongodb-sink-connector
[[mongodb-sink-architecture]]
== Architecture and how it works

The {prodname} MongoDB sink connector streams change data capture (CDC) events from Kafka topics to a MongoDB sink database.
The connector subscribes to Kafka topics that are populated with event messages produced by {prodname} relational database source connectors.
Each event message describes a database operation (insert, update, or delete) in a structured format that captures the details of the event.
The connector transforms incoming change event records into MongoDB document format, and then writes the resulting documents into the target MongoDB collection.

After it receives an event, the connector parses the event payload and determines which MongoDB collection to send it to.
It then performs one of the following operations in the target collection, depending on the event type that is specified in the event payload:

* For `insert` events, the connector creates a new document.
* For `update` events, it modifies an existing document based on a configurable identifier.
* For `delete` operations, it removes a document.

The connector uses the MongoDB Java driver to interact with the MongoDB database.

The mapping between topics and MongoDB collections is derived from the connector configuration.
The document key serves as a unique identifier for the document, ensuring that updates, inserts, and deletions are propagated to the correct MongoDB document and collection, and that operations are applied in the correct order.

Through this process of mapping event messages to MongoDB documents, the connector is able to mirror the state of tables in your relational database to collections in a MongoDB database.
For applications that require high scalability and fast data retrieval, propagating change data to a cluster-based MongoDB environment, which uses such features as sharding and replica sets to optimize read operations, can significantly improve retrieval performance.


// Type: concept
// Title: Limitations of the {prodname} MongoDB sink connector
// ModuleID: limitations-of-debezium-mongodb-sink-connector
[[mongodb-sink-limitations]]
== Limitations

The {prodname} MongoDB sink connector has the following limitations:

Relational database / RDBMS source connectors only::
The connector is designed to process messages originating from the following {prodname} relational database / RDBMS source connectors:

* MariaDB
* MySQL
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* SQL Server

The connector cannot process messages from a {prodname} MongoDB source connector or other non-RDBMS {prodname} source connector.

Schema evolution::
Although the connector can process basic schema changes, advanced schema evolution scenarios might require manual intervention or specific configuration.
Because MongoDB is schemaless, it has only a limited ability to handle schema evolution.

Transaction Support::
The connector processes individual change events in chronological order, based on the order in which operations are committed in the source system.
Although MongoDB supports transactions, the {prodname} MongoDB connector does not provide transactional guarantees across multiple CDC events or across multiple documents within a single sink task.

== Monitoring

This release of the connector does not expose any metrics.


// Type: concept
// Title: Key field mapping of the {prodname} MongoDB sink connector
// ModuleID: key-field-mapping-of-debezium-mongodb-sink-connector
[[mongodb-sink-key-field-mapping]]
== Key field mapping

* Keys from {prodname} change events, such as Kafka message keys, are mapped to the MongoDB `_id` field by default.
* Values are mapped into MongoDB documents.
* Updates and deletes are resolved based on the key field mapping.

The following example shows an event key in a Kafka topic:
[source,json,indent=0,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
    "userId": 1,
    "orderId": 1
}
----

Based on the mapping logic, the preceding key is mapped to the `_id` field in a MongoDB document, as showin in the following example:
[source,json,indent=0,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
    "_id": {
        "userId": 1,
        "orderId": 1
    }
}
----

// Title: Using CloudEvents with the {prodname} MongoDB sink connector
// ModuleID: cloudevents-with-debezium-mongodb-sink-connector
[[mongodb-sink-cloudevents]]
== Using CloudEvents with {prodname} MongoDB Sink Connector

The {prodname} MongoDB sink connector can consume records serialized as CloudEvents.
{prodname} can emit change events in CloudEvents format, so that the event payload is encapsulated in a standardized envelope.

When you enable CloudEvents on the source connector, the MongoDB sink connector parses the CloudEvents envelope.

The actual {prodname} event payload is extracted from the data section.

The event is then applied to the target MongoDB collection, following the standard insert, update, or delete semantics.

This process makes it possible to integrate {prodname} with broader event-driven systems while still persisting the resulting events in MongoDB.

.CloudEvents sink options
[cols="30%a,25%a,45%a"]
|===
|Property | Default | Description

|[[mongodb-sink-property-cloud-events]]<<mongodb-sink-property-cloud-events, `+cloud.events.schema.name.pattern+`>>
| `.*CloudEvents\.Envelope$`
| Regular expression pattern to identify CloudEvents messages by matching the schema name with this pattern.
