<p>Debezium&#8217;s MongoDB connector tracks a MongoDB replica set or a MongoDB sharded cluster for document changes in databases and collections, recording those changes as events in Kafka topics.
The connector automatically handles the addition or removal of shards in a sharded cluster, changes in membership of each replica set, elections within each replica set, and awaiting the resolution of communications problems.</p>

<h2 id="mongodb-overview">Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MongoDB&#8217;s replication mechanism provides redundancy and high availability, and is the preferred way to run MongoDB in production.
MongoDB connector captures the changes in a replica set or sharded cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A MongoDB <em>replica set</em> consists of a set of servers that all have copies of the same data, and replication ensures that all changes made by clients to documents on the replica set&#8217;s <em>primary</em> are correctly applied to the other replica set&#8217;s servers, called <em>secondaries</em>.
MongoDB replication works by having the primary record the changes in its <em>oplog</em> (or operation log), and then each of the secondaries reads the primary&#8217;s oplog and applies in order all of the operations to their own documents.
When a new server is added to a replica set, that server first performs an <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-sync/">snapshot</a> of all of the databases and collections on the primary, and then reads the primary&#8217;s oplog to apply all changes that might have been made since it began the snapshot.
This new server becomes a secondary (and able to handle queries) when it catches up to the tail of the primary&#8217;s oplog.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_change_stream">Change Stream</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Debezium MongoDB connector uses a similar replication mechanism to the one described above, though it does not actually become a member of the replica set.
The main difference is that the connector does not read the oplog directly, but delegates capturing and decoding the oplog to MongoDB&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/">Change Streams</a> feature.
With change streams, the MongoDB server exposes changes to collections as an event stream.
The Debezium connector watches the stream and delivers the changes downstream.
And, when the connector sees a replica set for the first time, it looks at the oplog to get the last recorded transaction and then performs a snapshot of the primary&#8217;s databases and collections.
When all the data is copied, the connector then creates a change stream from the position it read earlier from the oplog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the MongoDB connector processes changes, it periodically records the position in the oplog/stream where the event originated.
When the connector stops, it records the last oplog/stream position that it processed, so that upon restart it simply begins streaming from that position.
In other words, the connector can be stopped, upgraded or maintained, and restarted some time later, and it will pick up exactly where it left off without losing a single event.
Of course, MongoDB&#8217;s oplogs are usually capped at a maximum size, which means that the connector should not be stopped for too long, or else some of the operations in the oplog might be purged before the connector has a chance to read them.
In this case, upon restart the connector will detect the missing oplog operations, perform a snapshot, and then proceed with streaming the changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The MongoDB connector is also quite tolerant of changes in membership and leadership of the replica sets, of additions or removals of shards within a sharded cluster, and network problems that might cause communication failures.
The connector always uses the replica set&#8217;s primary node to stream changes, so when the replica set undergoes an election and a different node becomes primary, the connector will immediately stop streaming changes, connect to the new primary, and start streaming changes using the new primary node.
Likewise, if connector experiences any problems communicating with the replica set primary, it will try to reconnect (using exponential backoff so as to not overwhelm the network or replica set) and continue streaming changes from where it last left off.
In this way the connector is able to dynamically adjust to changes in replica set membership and to automatically handle communication failures.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An overview of the MongoDB topologies that the connector supports is useful for planning your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a MongoDB connector is configured and deployed, it starts by connecting to the MongoDB servers at the seed addresses, and determines the details about each of the available replica sets.
Since each replica set has its own independent oplog, the connector will try to use a separate task for each replica set.
The connector can limit the maximum number of tasks it will use, and if not enough tasks are available the connector will assign multiple replica sets to each task, although the task will still use a separate thread for each replica set.</p>

<p>When running the connector against a sharded cluster, use a value of <code>tasks.max</code> that is greater than the number of replica sets.

<p>The Debezium MongoDB connector can capture changes from a single <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/">MongoDB replica set</a>.
Production replica sets require a minimum of <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-architecture-three-members/">at least three members</a>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use the MongoDB connector with a replica set, provide the addresses of one or more replica set servers as <em>seed addresses</em> through the connector&#8217;s <code>mongodb.hosts</code> property.
The connector will use these seeds to connect to the replica set, and then once connected will get from the replica set the complete set of members and which member is primary.
The connector will start a task to connect to the primary and capture the changes from the primary&#8217;s oplog.
When the replica set elects a new primary, the task will automatically switch over to the new primary.</p>

<p>When MongoDB is fronted by a proxy (such as with Docker on OS X or Windows), then when a client connects to the replica set and discovers the members, the MongoDB client will exclude the proxy as a valid member and will attempt and fail to connect directly to the members rather than go through the proxy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In such a case, set the connector&#8217;s optional <code>mongodb.members.auto.discover</code> configuration property to <code>false</code> to instruct the connector to forgo membership discovery and instead simply use the first seed address (specified via the <code>mongodb.hosts</code> property) as the primary node.
This may work, but still make cause issues when election occurs.</p>

<p>The connector configuration property <code>topic.prefix</code> serves as a <em>logical name</em> for the MongoDB replica set or sharded cluster.
The connector uses the logical name in a number of ways: as the prefix for all topic names, and as a unique identifier when recording the change stream position of each replica set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should give each MongoDB connector a unique logical name that meaningfully describes the source MongoDB system.

<h3 id="mongodb-performing-a-snapshot">Performing a snapshot</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a task starts up using a replica set, it uses the connector&#8217;s logical name and the replica set name to find an <em>offset</em> that describes the position where the connector previously stopped reading changes.
If an offset can be found and it still exists in the oplog, then the task immediately proceeds with <a href="mongodb.html#mongodb-streaming-changes">streaming changes</a>, starting at the recorded offset position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if no offset is found or if the oplog no longer contains that position, the task must first obtain the current state of the replica set contents by performing a <em>snapshot</em>.
This process starts by recording the current position of the oplog and recording that as the offset (along with a flag that denotes a snapshot has been started).
The task will then proceed to copy each collection, spawning as many threads as possible (up to the value of the <code>snapshot.max.threads</code> configuration property) to perform this work in parallel.
The connector will record a separate <em>read event</em> for each document it sees, and that read event will contain the object&#8217;s identifier, the complete state of the object, and <em>source</em> information about the MongoDB replica set where the object was found.
The source information will also include a flag that denotes the event was produced during a snapshot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This snapshot will continue until it has copied all collections that match the connector&#8217;s filters.

<p>After the connector task for a replica set records an offset, it uses the offset to determine the position in the oplog where it should start streaming changes.
The task then (depending on the configuration) either connects to the replica set&#8217;s primary node or connects to a replica-set-wide change stream and starts streaming changes from that position.
It processes all of create, insert, and delete operations, and converts them into Debezium <a href="mongodb.html#mongodb-events">change events</a>.
Each change event includes the position in the oplog where the operation was found, and the connector periodically records this as its most recent offset.
The interval at which the offset is recorded is governed by <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#offset.flush.interval.ms"><code>offset.flush.interval.ms</code></a>, which is a Kafka Connect worker configuration property.</p>

<p>When the connector is stopped gracefully, the last offset processed is recorded so that, upon restart, the connector will continue exactly where it left off.
If the connector&#8217;s tasks terminate unexpectedly, however, then the tasks may have processed and generated events after it last records the offset but before the last offset is recorded; upon restart, the connector begins at the last <em>recorded</em> offset, possibly generating some the same events that were previously generated just prior to the crash.</p>

<p>The MongoDB connector writes events for all insert, update, and delete operations to documents in each collection to a single Kafka topic.
The name of the Kafka topics always takes the form <em>logicalName</em>.<em>databaseName</em>.<em>collectionName</em>, where <em>logicalName</em> is the <a href="mongodb.html#mongodb-logical-connector-name">logical name</a> of the connector as specified with the <code>topic.prefix</code> configuration property, <em>databaseName</em> is the name of the database where the operation occurred, and <em>collectionName</em> is the name of the MongoDB collection in which the affected document existed.</p>

<p>For example, consider a MongoDB replica set with an <code>inventory</code> database that contains four collections: <code>products</code>, <code>products_on_hand</code>, <code>customers</code>, and <code>orders</code>.
If the connector monitoring this database were given a logical name of <code>fulfillment</code>, then the connector would produce events on these four Kafka topics:</p>

<p>Notice that the topic names do not incorporate the replica set name or shard name.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Debezium MongoDB connector generates a data change event for each document-level operation that inserts, updates, or deletes data. Each event contains a key and a value. The structure of the key and the value depends on the collection that was changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Debezium and Kafka Connect are designed around <em>continuous streams of event messages</em>. However, the structure of these events may change over time, which can be difficult for consumers to handle. To address this, each event contains the schema for its content or, if you are using a schema registry, a schema ID that a consumer can use to obtain the schema from the registry. This makes each event self-contained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following skeleton JSON shows the basic four parts of a change event. However, how you configure the Kafka Connect converter that you choose to use in your application determines the representation of these four parts in change events. A <code>schema</code> field is in a change event only when you configure the converter to produce it. Likewise, the event key and event payload are in a change event only if you configure a converter to produce it. If you use the JSON converter and you configure it to produce all four basic change event parts, change events have this structure:</p>

<p>MongoDB connector events are designed to work with <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#compaction">Kafka log compaction</a>. Log compaction enables removal of some older messages as long as at least the most recent message for every key is kept.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All MongoDB connector events for a uniquely identified document have exactly the same key. When a document is deleted, the <em>delete</em> event value still works with log compaction because Kafka can remove all earlier messages that have that same key. However, for Kafka to remove all messages that have that key, the message value must be <code>null</code>. To make this possible, after Debezium’s MongoDB connector emits a <em>delete</em> event, the connector emits a special tombstone event that has the same key but a <code>null</code> value. A tombstone event informs Kafka that all messages with that same key can be removed.</p>

<p>The MongoDB connector uses MongoDB&#8217;s change streams to capture the changes, so the connector works only with MongoDB replica sets or with sharded clusters where each shard is a separate replica set.
See the MongoDB documentation for setting up a <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/">replica set</a> or <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/">sharded cluster</a>.
Also, be sure to understand how to enable <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/deploy-replica-set-with-keyfile-access-control/#deploy-repl-set-with-auth">access control and authentication</a> with replica sets.</p>

<p>You must also have a MongoDB user that has the appropriate roles to read the <code>admin</code> database where the oplog can be read. Additionally, the user must also be able to read the <code>config</code> database in the configuration server of a sharded cluster and must have <code>listDatabases</code> privilege action.
When change streams are used (the default) the user also must have cluster-wide privilege actions <code>find</code> and <code>changeStream</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you intend to utilize pre-image and populate the <code>before</code> field, you need to first enable <code>changeStreamPreAndPostImages</code> for a collection using <code>db.createCollection()</code>, <code>create</code>, or <code>collMod</code>.</p>

During this discovery process, the connector ignores connection values that are specified in other properties (<code>mongodb.user</code>, <code>mongodb.password</code>, <code>mongodb.authsource</code>, SSL configuration properties, and so forth).
After the discovery process completes, when the connector attempts to establish a direct connection to a primary replica set member, the connector then returns to using the standard connection properties,
and it ignores values in <code>mongodb.connection.string</code>.
However, if credential information is not present elsewhere in the configuration, the connector can extract credential information from the value of the connection string.

<p>Controls how frequently heartbeat messages are sent.<br>
This property contains an interval in milliseconds that defines how frequently the connector sends messages into a heartbeat topic.
This can be used to monitor whether the connector is still receiving change events from the database.
You also should leverage heartbeat messages in cases where only records in non-captured collections are changed for a longer period of time.
In such situation the connector would proceed to read the oplog/change stream from the database but never emit any change messages into Kafka,
which in turn means that no offset updates are committed to Kafka.
This will cause the oplog files to be rotated out but connector will not notice it so on restart some events are no longer available which leads to the need of re-execution of the initial snapshot.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the Kafka Connector process stops unexpectedly, then any connector tasks it was running will terminate without recording their most recently-processed offsets.
When Kafka Connect is being run in distributed mode, it will restart those connector tasks on other processes.
However, the MongoDB connectors will resume from the last offset <em>recorded</em> by the earlier processes, which means that the new replacement tasks may generate some of the same change events that were processed just prior to the crash.
The number of duplicate events depends on the offset flush period and the volume of data changes just before the crash.</p>

<h3 id="debezium-mongodb-kafka-process-becomes-unavailable">Kafka becomes unavailable</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the connector generates change events, the Kafka Connect framework records those events in Kafka using the Kafka producer API. Kafka Connect will also periodically record the latest offset that appears in those change events, at a frequency that you have specified in the Kafka Connect worker configuration. If the Kafka brokers become unavailable, the Kafka Connect worker process running the connectors will simply repeatedly attempt to reconnect to the Kafka brokers. In other words, the connector tasks will simply pause until a connection can be reestablished, at which point the connectors will resume exactly where they left off.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="debezium-mongodb-connector-is-stopped-for-a-long-interval">Connector fails after it is stopped for a long interval if <code>snapshot.mode</code> is set to <code>initial</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the connector is gracefully stopped, users might continue to perform operations on replica set members.
Changes that occur while the connector is offline continue to be recorded in MongoDB&#8217;s oplog.
In most cases, after the connector is restarted, it reads the offset value in the oplog to determine the last operation that it streamed for each replica set, and then resumes streaming changes from that point.
After the restart, database operations that occurred while the connector was stopped are emitted to Kafka as usual, and after some time, the connector catches up with the database.
The amount of time required for the connector to catch up depends on the capabilities and performance of Kafka and the volume of changes that occurred in the database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if the connector remains stopped for a long enough interval, it can occur that MongoDB purges the oplog during the time that the connector is inactive, resulting in the loss of information about the connector&#8217;s last position.
After the connector restarts, it cannot resume streaming, because the oplog no longer contains the previous offset value that marks the last operation that the connector processed.
The connector also cannot perform a snapshot, as it typically would when the <code>snapshot.mode</code> property is set to <code>initial</code>, and no offset value is present.
In this case, a mismatch exists, because the oplog does not contain the value of the previous offset, but the offset value is present in the connector&#8217;s internal Kafka offsets topic.
An error results and the connector fails.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To recover from the failure, delete the failed connector, and create a new connector with the same configuration but with a different connector name.
When you start the new connector, it performs a snapshot to ingest the state of database, and then resumes streaming.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="mongodb-crash-results-in-lost-commits">MongoDB loses writes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In certain failure situations, MongoDB can lose commits, which results in the MongoDB connector being unable to capture the lost changes.
For example, if the primary crashes suddenly after it applies a change and records the change to its oplog, the oplog might become unavailable before secondary nodes can read its contents.
As a result, the secondary node that is elected as the new primary node might be missing the most recent changes from its oplog.</p>

<p>At this time, there is no way to prevent this side effect in MongoDB.</p>
