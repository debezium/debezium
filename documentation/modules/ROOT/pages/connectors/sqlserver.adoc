The {prodname} SQL Server connector captures row-level changes that occur in the schemas of a SQL Server database.

The first time that the {prodname} SQL Server connector connects to a SQL Server database or cluster, it takes a consistent snapshot of the schemas in the database.
After the initial snapshot is complete, the connector continuously captures row-level changes for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations that are committed to the SQL Server databases that are enabled for CDC. 
The connector produces events for each data change operation, and streams them to Kafka topics. 
The connector streams all of the events for a table to a dedicated Kafka topic.
Applications and services can then consume data change event records from that topic.


// Type: concept
// Title: Overview of {prodname} SQL Server connector 
// ModuleID: overview-of-debezium-sql-server-connector
[[sqlserver-overview]]
== Overview

The {prodname} SQL Server connector is based on the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017[change data capture] 
feature that is available in https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlreleaseservices/sql-server-2016-service-pack-1-sp1-released/[SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later] Standard edition or Enterprise edition.
The SQL Server capture process monitors designated databases and tables, and stores the changes into specifically created _change tables_ that have stored procedure facades.

To enable the {prodname} SQL Server connector to capture change event records for database operations, 
you must first enable change data capture on the SQL Server database. 
CDC must be enabled on both the database and on each table that you want to capture.
After you set up CDC on the source database, the connector can capture row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations  
that occur in the database.
The connector writes event records for each source table to a Kafka topic especially dedicated to that table.
One topic exists for each captured table.
Client applications read the Kafka topics for the database tables that they follow, and can respond to the row-level events they they consume from those topics.

The first time that the connector connects to a SQL Server database or cluster, it takes a consistent snapshot of the schemas for all tables for which it is configured to capture changes,
and streams this state to Kafka.
After the snapshot is complete, the connector continuously captures subsequent row-level changes that occur.
By first establishing a consistent view of all of the data, the connector can continue reading without having lost any of the changes that were made while the snapshot was taking place.

The {prodname} SQL Server connector is tolerant of failures.
As the connector reads changes and produces events, it periodically records the position of events in the database log (_LSN / Log Sequence Number_).
If the connector stops for any reason (including communication failures, network problems, or crashes), after a restart the connector resumes reading the SQL Server _CDC_ tables from the last point that it read.

NOTE: Offsets are committed periodically. 
They are not committed at the time that a change event occurs. 
As a result, following an outage, duplicate events might be generated.

Fault tolerance also applies to snapshots. 
That is, if the connector stops during a snapshot, the connector begins a new snapshot when it restarts.

== How the SQL Server connector works

To optimally configure and run a {prodname} SQL Server connector, it is helpful to understand how the connector performs snapshots, streams change events, determines Kafka topic names, and uses metadata.

// Title: How {prodname} SQL Server connectors perform database snapshots
[[sqlserver-snapshots]]
=== Snapshots

SQL Server CDC is not designed to store a complete history of database changes.
For the {prodname} SQL Server connector to establish a baseline for the current state of the database, 
it uses a process called _snapshotting_.

You can configure how the connector creates snapshots.
By default, the connector's snapshot mode is set to `initial`. 
Based on this `initial` snapshot mode, the first time that the connector starts, it performs an initial _consistent snapshot_ of the database.
This initial snapshot captures the structure and data for any tables that match the criteria defined by the `include` and `exclude` properties that are configured for the connector (for example, `table.include.list`, `column.include.list`, `table.exclude.list`, and so forth).

When the connector creates a snapshot, it completes the following tasks:

1. Determines the tables to be captured.
2. Obtains a lock on each table for which CDC is enabled to ensure that no structural changes occur in the tables.
The level of the lock is determined by `snapshot.isolation.mode` configuration option.
3. Reads the maximum log sequence number (LSN) position in the server's transaction log.
4. Captures the structure of all relevant tables.
5. Releases the locks obtained in Step 2, if necessary. In most cases, locks are held for only a short period of time.
6. Scans all of the relevant database tables and schemas based on the LSN position that it read in Step 3, generates a `READ` event for each row, and writes the events to the Kafka topic for the table.
7. Records the successful completion of the snapshot in the connector offsets.


// Type: concept
// ModuleID: how-the-debezium-sql-server-connector-reads-change-data-tables
// Title: How {prodname} SQL Server connectors read change data tables
=== Reading the change data tables

When the connector first starts, it takes a structural snapshot of the structure of the captured tables
and persists this information to its internal database history topic.
The connector then identifies a change table for each source table, and completes the following steps.

1. For each change table, the connector read all of the changes that were created between the last stored maximum LSN and the current maximum LSN.
2. The connector sorts the changes that it reads in ascending order, based on the values of their commit LSN and change LSN.
This sorting order ensures that the changes are replayed by {prodname} in the same order in which they occurred in the database.
3. The connector passes the commit and change LSNs as offsets to Kafka Connect.
4. The connector stores the maximum LSN and restarts the process from Step 1.

After a restart, the connector resumes processing from the last offset (commit and change LSNs) that it read.

The connector is able to detect whether CDC is enabled or disabled for included source tables and adjust its behavior.

// Type: concept
// ModuleID: default-names-of-kafka-topics-that-receive-debezium-sql-server-change-event-records
// Title: Default names of Kafka topics that receive {prodname} SQL Server change event records
[[sqlserver-topic-names]]
=== Topic names

The SQL Server connector writes events for all `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations for a specific table to a single Kafka topic. 
By default, the Kafka topic name takes the form _serverName_._schemaName_._tableName_.
The following list provides definitions for the components of the default name: 

_serverName_:: The logical name of the connector, as specified by the `database.server.name` configuration property.
_schemaName_:: The name of the database schema in which the change event occurred.
_tableName_:: The name of the database table in which the change event occurred.

For example, suppose that `fulfillment` is the logical server name in the configuration for a connector that is capturing changes in a SQL Server installation.
The server has an `inventory` database with the schema name `dbo`, and the database contains tables with the names `products`, `products_on_hand`, `customers`, and `orders`. 
The connector would stream records to the following Kafka topics: 

* `fulfillment.dbo.products`
* `fulfillment.dbo.products_on_hand`
* `fulfillment.dbo.customers`
* `fulfillment.dbo.orders`

If the default topic name do not meet your requirements, you can configure custom topic names.
To configure custom topic names, you specify regular expressions in the logical topic routing SMT. 
For more information about using the logical topic routing SMT to customize topic naming, see {link-prefix}:{link-topic-routing}#topic-routing[Topic routing].  

 
// Type: concept
// ModuleID: how-the-debezium-sql-server-connector-uses-the-schema-change-topic
// Title: How the {prodname} SQL Server connector uses the schema change topic
=== Schema change topic

For each table for which CDC is enabled, the {prodname} SQL Server connector stores a history of schema changes in a database history topic. 
This topic reflects an internal connector state and you should not use it directly. 
Application that require notifications about schema changes, should obtain the information from the public schema change topic. 
The connector writes all of these events to a Kafka topic named `<serverName>`, where `serverName` is the name of the connector that is specified in the database.server.name configuration property. 

[WARNING]
====
The format of the messages that a connector emits to its schema change topic is in an incubating state and can change without notice.
====

{prodname} emits a message to the schema change topic when the following events occur:

* You enable CDC for a table. 
* You disable CDC for a table.
* You alter the structure of a table for which CDC is enabled by following the {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#sqlserver-schema-evolution[schema evolution procedure].

A message to the schema change topic contains a logical representation of the table schema, for example:

// Title: Descriptions of {prodname} SQL Server connector data change events
=== Data change events

The {prodname} SQL Server connector generates a data change event for each row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operation. Each event contains a key and a value. The structure of the key and the value depends on the table that was changed. 

{prodname} and Kafka Connect are designed around _continuous streams of event messages_. However, the structure of these events may change over time, which can be difficult for consumers to handle. To address this, each event contains the schema for its content or, if you are using a schema registry, a schema ID that a consumer can use to obtain the schema from the registry. This makes each event self-contained. 

The following skeleton JSON shows the basic four parts of a change event. However, how you configure the Kafka Connect converter that you choose to use in your application determines the representation of these four parts in change events. A `schema` field is in a change event only when you configure the converter to produce it. Likewise, the event key and event payload are in a change event only if you configure a converter to produce it. If you use the JSON converver and you configure it to produce all four basic change event parts, change events have this structure: 

[source,json,index=0]
----
{
 "schema": { // <1>
   ...
  },
 "payload": { // <2>
   ...
 },
 "schema": { // <3> 
   ...
 },
 "payload": { // <4>
   ...
 },
}
----

.Overview of change event basic content
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`schema`
|The first `schema` field is part of the event key. It specifies a Kafka Connect schema that describes what is in the event key's `payload` portion. In other words, the first `schema` field describes the structure of the primary key, or the unique key if the table does not have a primary key, for the table that was changed. +
 +
It is possible to override the table's primary key by setting the {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#sqlserver-property-message-key-columns[`message.key.columns` connector configuration property]. In this case, the first schema field describes the structure of the key identified by that property.

|2
|`payload`
|The first `payload` field is part of the event key. It has the structure described by the previous `schema` field and it contains the key for the row that was changed. 

|3
|`schema`
|The second `schema` field is part of the event value. It specifies the Kafka Connect schema that describes what is in the event value's `payload` portion. In other words, the second `schema` describes the structure of the row that was changed. Typically, this schema contains nested schemas. 

|4
|`payload`
|The second `payload` field is part of the event value. It has the structure described by the previous `schema` field and it contains the actual data for the row that was changed.

|===

By default, the connector streams change event records to topics with names that are the same as the event's originating table. See {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#sqlserver-topic-names[topic names].

[WARNING]
====
The SQL Server connector ensures that all Kafka Connect schema names adhere to the link:http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#names[Avro schema name format]. This means that the logical server name must start with a Latin letter or an underscore, that is, a-z, A-Z, or \_. Each remaining character in the logical server name and each character in the database and table names must be a Latin letter, a digit, or an underscore, that is, a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or \_. If there is an invalid character it is replaced with an underscore character.

This can lead to unexpected conflicts if the logical server name, a database name, or a table name contains invalid characters, and the only characters that distinguish names from one another are invalid and thus replaced with underscores.

==== Change event keys

A change event's key contains the schema for the changed table's key and the changed row's actual key. Both the schema and its corresponding payload contain a field for each column in the changed table's primary key (or unique key constraint) at the time the connector created the event.

Consider the following `customers` table, which is followed by an example of a change event key for this table. 

.Example table
[source,sql,indent=0]
----
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER IDENTITY(1001,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
----

.Example change event key
Every change event that captures a change to the `customers` table has the same event key schema. For as long as the `customers` table has the previous definition, every change event that captures a change to the `customers` table has the following key structure, which in JSON, looks like this:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
    "schema": { // <1>
        "type": "struct",
        "fields": [ // <2>
            {
                "type": "int32",
                "optional": false,
                "field": "id"
            }
        ],
        "optional": false, // <3>
        "name": "server1.dbo.customers.Key" // <4>
    },
    "payload": { // <5>
        "id": 1004
    }
}

|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`schema`
|The schema portion of the key specifies a Kafka Connect schema that describes what is in the key's `payload` portion. 

|2
|`fields` 
|Specifies each field that is expected in the `payload`, including each field's name, type, and whether it is required. In this example, there is one required field named `id` of type `int32`.

|3
|`optional`
|Indicates whether the event key must contain a value in its `payload` field. In this example, a value in the key's payload is required. A value in the key's payload field is optional when a table does not have a primary key.

|4
|`server1.dbo{zwsp}.customers{zwsp}.Key`
a|Name of the schema that defines the structure of the key's payload. This schema describes the structure of the primary key for the table that was changed. Key schema names have the format _connector-name_._database-schema-name_._table-name_.`Key`. In this example: + 

* `server1` is the name of the connector that generated this event. + 
* `dbo` is the database schema for the table that was changed. +
* `customers` is the table that was updated.

|5
|`payload`
|Contains the key for the row for which this change event was generated. In this example, the key, contains a single `id` field whose value is `1004`.

ifdef::community[]
[NOTE]
====
Although the `column.exclude.list` and `column.include.list` connector configuration properties allow you to capture only a subset of table columns, all columns in a primary or unique key are always included in the event's key.
====

[WARNING]
====
If the table does not have a primary or unique key, then the change event's key is null. This makes sense since the rows in a table without a primary or unique key constraint cannot be uniquely identified.

==== Change event values

The value in a change event is a bit more complicated than the key. Like the key, the value has a `schema` section and a `payload` section. The `schema` section contains the schema that describes the `Envelope` structure of the `payload` section, including its nested fields. Change events for operations that create, update or delete data all have a value payload with an envelope structure. 

Consider the same sample table that was used to show an example of a change event key: 

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER IDENTITY(1001,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

.Descriptions of _create_ event value fields
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`schema`
|The value's schema, which describes the structure of the value's payload. A change event's value schema is the same in every change event that the connector generates for a particular table. 

|2
|`name`
a|In the `schema` section, each `name` field specifies the schema for a field in the value's payload. +
 +
`server1.dbo.customers.Value` is the schema for the payload's `before` and `after` fields. This schema is specific to the `customers` table. +
 +
 Names of schemas for `before` and `after` fields are of the form `_logicalName_._database-schemaName_._tableName_.Value`, which ensures that the schema name is unique in the database. This means that when using the {link-prefix}:{link-avro-serialization}[Avro converter], the resulting Avro schema for each table in each logical source has its own evolution and history.

|3
|`name`
a|`io.debezium.connector.sqlserver.Source` is the schema for the payload's `source` field. This schema is specific to the SQL Server connector. The connector uses it for all events that it generates. 

|4
|`name`
a|`server1.dbo.customers.Envelope` is the schema for the overall structure of the payload, where `server1` is the connector name, `dbo` is the database schema name, and `customers` is the table.

|5
|`payload`
|The value's actual data. This is the information that the change event is providing. +
 +
It may appear that the JSON representations of the events are much larger than the rows they describe. This is because the JSON representation must include the schema and the payload portions of the message.
However, by using the {link-prefix}:{link-avro-serialization}[Avro converter], you can significantly decrease the size of the messages that the connector streams to Kafka topics.

|6
|`before`
|An optional field that specifies the state of the row before the event occurred. When the `op` field is `c` for create, as it is in this example, the `before` field is `null` since this change event is for new content. 

|7
|`after`
|An optional field that specifies the state of the row after the event occurred. In this example, the `after` field contains the values of the new row's `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` columns.

|8
|`source`
a|Mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event. This field contains information that you can use to compare this event with other events, with regard to the origin of the events, the order in which the events occurred, and whether events were part of the same transaction. The source metadata includes: 

* {prodname} version
* Connector type and name
* Database and schema names
* Timestamp for when the change was made in the database
* If the event was part of a snapshot
* Name of the table that contains the new row
* Server log offsets

|9
|`op`
a|Mandatory string that describes the type of operation that caused the connector to generate the event. In this example, `c` indicates that the operation created a row. Valid values are: 

* `c` = create
* `u` = update
* `d` = delete
* `r` = read (applies to only snapshots)

|10
|`ts_ms`
a|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event. The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task. +
 +
In the `source` object, `ts_ms` indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for `payload.source.ts_ms` with the value for `payload.ts_ms`, you can determine the lag between the source database update and {prodname}.

|===

[[sqlserver-update-events]]
===== _update_ events

The value of a change event for an update in the sample `customers` table has the same schema as a _create_ event for that table. Likewise, the event value's payload has the same structure. However, the event value payload contains different values in an _update_ event. Here is an example of a change event value in an event that the connector generates for an update in the `customers` table: 

[source,json,indent=0,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
  "schema": { ... },
  "payload": {
    "before": { // <1>
      "id": 1005,

      "last_name": "doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.org"
    },
    "after": { // <2>
      "id": 1005,
      "first_name": "john",

      "email": "noreply@example.org"
    },

  }
}

.Descriptions of _update_ event value fields
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`before`
|An optional field that specifies the state of the row before the event occurred. In an _update_ event value, the `before` field contains a field for each table column and the value that was in that column before the database commit. In this example, the `email` value is `john.doe@example.org.`

|2
|`after`
| An optional field that specifies the state of the row after the event occurred. You can compare the `before` and `after` structures to determine what the update to this row was. In the example, the `email` value is now `noreply@example.org`. 

|3
|`source`
a|Mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event. The `source` field structure has the same fields as in a _create_ event, but some values are different, for example, the sample _update_ event has a different offset. The source metadata includes: 

* {prodname} version
* Connector type and name
* Database and schema names
* Timestamp for when the change was made in the database
* If the event was part of a snapshot
* Name of the table that contains the new row
* Server log offsets

The `event_serial_no` field differentiates events that have the same commit and change LSN. Typical situations for when this field has a value other than `1`:

* _update_ events have the value set to `2` because the update generates two events in the CDC change table of SQL Server (link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-tables/cdc-capture-instance-ct-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017[see the source documentation for details]). The first event contains the old values and the second contains contains new values. The connector uses values in the first event to create the second event. The connector drops the first event. 

* When a primary key is updated SQL Server emits two evemts. A _delete_ event for the removal of the record with the old primary key value and a _create_ event for the addition of the record with the new primary key.
Both operations share the same commit and change LSN and their event numbers are `1` and `2`, respectively. 

|4
|`op`
a|Mandatory string that describes the type of operation. In an _update_ event value, the `op` field value is `u`, signifying that this row changed because of an update.

|5
|`ts_ms`
a|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event. The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.  +
 +
In the `source` object, `ts_ms` indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for `payload.source.ts_ms` with the value for `payload.ts_ms`, you can determine the lag between the source database update and {prodname}.


|===

[NOTE]
====
Updating the columns for a row's primary/unique key changes the value of the row's key. When a key changes, {prodname} outputs _three_ events: a _delete_ event and a {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#sqlserver-tombstone-events[tombstone event] with the old key for the row, followed by a _create_ event with the new key for the row.
====

[[sqlserver-delete-events]]
===== _delete_ events

The value in a _delete_ change event has the same `schema` portion as _create_ and _update_ events for the same table. The `payload` portion in a _delete_ event for the sample `customers` table looks like this:  

[source,json,indent=0,subs="+attributes"]
----

  "schema": { ... },
  },
  "payload": {
    "before": { <>

.Descriptions of _delete_ event value fields
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`before`
|Optional field that specifies the state of the row before the event occurred. In a _delete_ event value, the `before` field contains the values that were in the row before it was deleted with the database commit.

|2
|`after`
| Optional field that specifies the state of the row after the event occurred. In a _delete_ event value, the `after` field is `null`, signifying that the row no longer exists.

|3
|`source`
a|Mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event. In a _delete_ event value, the `source` field structure is the same as for _create_ and _update_ events for the same table. Many `source` field values are also the same. In a _delete_ event value, the `ts_ms` and `pos` field values, as well as other values, might have changed. But the `source` field in a _delete_ event value provides the same metadata: 

* {prodname} version
* Connector type and name
* Database and schema names
* Timestamp for when the change was made in the database
* If the event was part of a snapshot
* Name of the table that contains the new row
* Server log offsets

|4
|`op`
a|Mandatory string that describes the type of operation. The `op` field value is `d`, signifying that this row was deleted.

|5
|`ts_ms`
a|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event. The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.  +
 +
In the `source` object, `ts_ms` indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for `payload.source.ts_ms` with the value for `payload.ts_ms`, you can determine the lag between the source database update and {prodname}.

|===

SQL Server connector events are designed to work with link:{link-kafka-docs}/#compaction[Kafka log compaction]. Log compaction enables removal of some older messages as long as at least the most recent message for every key is kept. This lets Kafka reclaim storage space while ensuring that the topic contains a complete data set and can be used for reloading key-based state.

[[sqlserver-tombstone-events]]
.Tombstone events
When a row is deleted, the _delete_ event value still works with log compaction, because Kafka can remove all earlier messages that have that same key. However, for Kafka to remove all messages that have that same key, the message value must be `null`. To make this possible, after {prodname}’s SQL Server connector emits a _delete_ event, the connector emits a special tombstone event that has the same key but a `null` value.

// Type: assembly
// ModuleID: debezium-sql-server-connector-generated-events-that-represent-transaction-boundaries
// Title: {prodname} SQL Server connector-generated events that represent transaction boundaries
[[sqlserver-transaction-metadata]]
=== Transaction metadata

{prodname} can generate events that represent transaction boundaries and that enrich data change event messages. 

Database transactions are represented by a statement block that is enclosed between the `BEGIN` and `END` keywords. 
{prodname} generates transaction boundary events for the `BEGIN` and `END` delimiters in every transaction. 
Transaction boundary events contain the following fields: 

`status`:: `BEGIN` or `END`
`id`:: String representation of unique transaction identifier.
`event_count` (for `END` events):: Total number of events emitted by the transaction.
`data_collections` (for `END` events):: An array of pairs of `data_collection` and `event_count` that provides the number of events emitted by changes originating from given data collection.

The following example shows a typical transaction boundary message:

.Example: SQL Server connector transaction boundary event

  "status": "BEGIN",
  "id": "00000025:00000d08:0025",

    },
    {
      "data_collection": "testDB.dbo.tableb",
      "event_count": 1
    }
  ]
}
----

The transaction events are written to the topic named `<database.server.name>.transaction`.

//Type: concept
//ModuleID: change-data-event-enrichment
==== Change data event enrichment

When transaction metadata is enabled, the data message `Envelope` is enriched with a new `transaction` field.
This field provides information about every event in the form of a composite of fields:

`id`:: String representation of unique transaction identifier
`total_order`:: The absolute position of the event among all events generated by the transaction
`data_collection_order`:: The per-data collection position of the event among all events that were emitted by the transaction

The following example shows what a typical message looks like:

// Type: reference
// ModuleID: how-debezium-sql-server-connectors-map-data-types
// Title: How {prodname} SQL Server connectors map data types
[[sqlserver-data-types]]
=== Data type mappings

The {prodname} SQL Server connector represents changes to table row data by producing events that are structured like the table in which the row exists.
Each event contains fields to represent the column values for the row. 
The way in which an event represents the column values for an operation depends on the SQL data type of the column. 
In the event, the connector maps the fields for each SQL Server data type to both a _literal type_ and a _semantic type_. 

The connector can map SQL Server data types to both _literal_ and _semantic_ types.

Literal type:: Describes how the value is literally represented by using Kafka Connect schema types, namely `INT8`, `INT16`, `INT32`, `INT64`, `FLOAT32`, `FLOAT64`, `BOOLEAN`, `STRING`, `BYTES`, `ARRAY`, `MAP`, and `STRUCT`.
Semantic type:: Describes how the Kafka Connect schema captures the _meaning_ of the field using the name of the Kafka Connect schema for the field.

A string representation of a timestamp with timezone information, where the timezone is GMT

|===

Other data type mappings are described in the following sections.

If present, a column's default value is propagated to the corresponding field's Kafka Connect schema.
Change messages will contain the field's default value
(unless an explicit column value had been given), so there should rarely be the need to obtain the default value from the schema.
ifdef::community[]
Passing the default value helps though with satisfying the compatibility rules when {link-prefix}:{link-avro-serialization}[using Avro] as serialization format together with the Confluent schema registry.
endif::community[]

[[sql-server-temporal-values]]
==== Temporal values

Other than SQL Server's `DATETIMEOFFSET` data type (which contain time zone information), the other temporal types depend on the value of the `time.precision.mode` configuration property.  When the `time.precision.mode` configuration property is set to `adaptive` (the default), then the connector will determine the literal type and semantic type for the temporal types based on the column's data type definition so that events _exactly_ represent the values in the database:

When the `time.precision.mode` configuration property is set to `connect`, then the connector will use the predefined Kafka Connect logical types. This may be useful when consumers only know about the built-in Kafka Connect logical types and are unable to handle variable-precision time values. On the other hand, since SQL Server supports tenth of microsecond precision, the events generated by a connector with the `connect` time precision mode will *result in a loss of precision* when the database column has a _fractional second precision_ value greater than 3:

===== Timestamp values

The `DATETIME`, `SMALLDATETIME` and `DATETIME2` types represent a timestamp without time zone information.
Such columns are converted into an equivalent Kafka Connect value based on UTC.
So for instance the `DATETIME2` value "2018-06-20 15:13:16.945104" is represented by a `io.debezium.time.MicroTimestamp` with the value "1529507596945104".

Note that the timezone of the JVM running Kafka Connect and {prodname} does not affect this conversion.

[[setting-up-sqlserver]]
== Setting up SQL Server

For {prodname} to capture change events from SQL Server tables, a SQL Server administrator with the necessary privileges must first run a query to enable CDC on the database. 
The administrator must then enable CDC for each table that you want Debezium to capture.   

ifdef::product[]

For details about setting up SQL Server for use with the {prodname} connector, see the following sections:

* xref:enabling-cdc-on-the-sql-server-database[]
* xref:enabling-cdc-on-a-sql-server-table[]
* xref:verifying-debezium-connector-access-to-the-cdc-table[]
* xref:debezium-sql-server-connector-on-azure[]

endif::product[]

After CDC is applied, it captures all of the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations that are committed to the tables for which CDD is enabled.
The {prodname} connector can then capture these events and emit them to Kafka topics.

// Type: procedure
// ModuleID: enabling-cdc-on-the-sql-server-database
=== Enabling CDC on the SQL Server database

Before you can enable CDC for a table, you must enable it for the SQL Server database.
A SQL Server administrator enables CDC by running a system stored procedure. 
System stored procedures can be run by using SQL Server Management Studio, or by using Transact-SQL.

.Prerequisites
* You are a member of the _sysadmin_ fixed server role for the SQL Server.
* You are a db_owner of the database. 
* The SQL Server Agent is running.  

NOTE: The SQL Server CDC feature processes changes that occur in user-created tables only. You cannot enable CDC on the SQL Server `master` database.

.Procedure

. From the *View* menu in SQL Server Management Studio, click *Template Explorer*.
. In the *Template Browser*, expand *SQL Server Templates*.
. Expand *Change Data Capture > Configuration* and then click *Enable Database for CDC*.  
. In the template, replace the database name in the `USE` statement with the name of the database that you want to enable for CDC.
. Run the stored procedure `sys.sp_cdc_enable_db` to enable the database for CDC.
+
After the database is enabled for CDC, a schema with the name `cdc` is created, along with a CDC user, metadata tables, and other system objects.
+
The following example shows how to enable CDC for the database `MyDB`:
+
.Example: Enabling a SQL Server database for the CDC template
[source,sql]
----
USE MyDB
GO
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db
GO
----

// Type: procedure
// ModuleID: enabling-cdc-on-a-sql-server-table
=== Enabling CDC on a SQL Server table

A SQL Server administrator must enable change data capture on the source tables that you want to Debezium to capture.
The database must already be enabled for CDC.
To enable CDC on a table, a SQL Server administrator runs the stored procedure `sys.sp_cdc_enable_table` for the table.
The stored procedures can be run by using SQL Server Management Studio, or by using Transact-SQL.
SQL Server CDC must be enabled for every table that you want to capture. 

.Prerequisites
* CDC is enabled on the SQL Server database.
* The SQL Server Agent is running.  
* You are a member of the `db_owner` fixed database role for the database. 

.Procedure
. From the *View* menu in SQL Server Management Studio, click *Template Explorer*.
. In the *Template Browser*, expand *SQL Server Templates*.
. Expand *Change Data Capture > Configuration*, and then click *Enable Table Specifying Filegroup Option*.  
. In the template, replace the table name in the `USE` statement with the name of the table that you want to capture.
. Run the stored procedure `sys.sp_cdc_enable_table`.
+ 
The following example shows how to enable CDC for the table `MyTable`:
+
.Example: Enabling CDC for a SQL Server table
[source,sql]
----
USE MyDB
GO

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
@source_schema = N'dbo',
@source_name   = N'MyTable', //<.>
@role_name     = N'MyRole',  //<.>
@filegroup_name = N'MyDB_CT',//<.>
@supports_net_changes = 0
GO
----
<.> Specifies the name of the table that you want to capture.
<.> Specifies a role `MyRole` to which you can add users to whom you want to grant `SELECT` permission on the captured columns of the source table. 
Users in the `sysadmin` or `db_owner` role also have access to the specified change tables. Set the value of `@role_name` to `NULL`, to allow only members in the `sysadmin` or `db_owner` to have full access to captured information.
<.> Specifies the `filegroup` where SQL Server places the change table for the captured table. 
The named `filegroup` must already exist. 
It is best not to locate change tables in the same `filegroup` that you use for source tables.


// Type: procedure
// ModuleID: verifying-debezium-connector-access-to-the-cdc-table
=== Verifying that the user has access to the CDC table

A SQL Server administrator can run a system stored procedure to query a database or table to retrieve its CDC configuration information.
The stored procedures can be run by using SQL Server Management Studio, or by using Transact-SQL.

.Prerequisites
* You have `SELECT` permission on all of the captured columns of the capture instance. 
Members of the `db_owner` database role can view information for all of the defined capture instances.
* You have membership in any gating roles that are defined for the table information that the query includes. 

.Procedure

. From the *View* menu in SQL Server Management Studio, click *Object Explorer*.
. From the Object Explorer, expand *Databases*, and then expand your database object, for example, *MyDB*. 
. Expand *Programmability > Stored Procedures > System Stored Procedures*.
. Run the `sys.sp_cdc_help_change_data_capture` stored procedure to query the table.
+
Queries should not return empty results.
+
The following example runs the stored precedure `sys.sp_cdc_help_change_data_capture` on the database `MyDB`:
+
.Example: Querying a table for CDC configuration information
[source, sql]
----
USE MyDB;
GO
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_help_change_data_capture
GO
----
+
The query returns configuration information for each table in the database that is enabled for CDC and that contains change data that the caller is authorized to access.
If the result is empty, verify that the user has privileges to access both the capture instance and the CDC tables.

[[sqlserver-always-on-replica]]
=== SQL Server Always On

The SQL Server connector can capture changes from an Always On read-only replica.
A few pre-requisities are necessary to be fulfilled:

* Change data capture is configured and enabled on the primary node.
SQL Server does not support CDC directly on replicas.
* The configuration option `database.applicationIntent` must be set to `ReadOnly`.
This is required by SQL Server.
When {prodname} detects this configuration option then it will:

** set `snapshot.isolation.mode` to `snapshot` as this is the only one transaction isolation mode supported by read-only replicas
** commit the (read-only) transaction in every execution of the streaming query loop, as this is necessary to get the latest view on CDC data

==== Installing

To install the SQL Server connector, follow the procedures in {LinkDebeziumInstallOpenShift}[{NameDebeziumInstallOpenShift}]. The main steps are:

. Use link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-amq#streams[Red Hat AMQ Streams] to set up Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect on OpenShift. AMQ Streams offers operators and images that bring Kafka to OpenShift. 

. From a browser, open the link:https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=red.hat.integration&downloadType=distributions[Software Downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal], 
and download the {prodname} SQL Server connector.

. Extract the connector files into your Kafka Connect environment.
. Add the connector plug-in's parent directory to your Kafka Connect `plugin.path`, for example: 
+
[source]
----
plugin.path=/kafka/connect
----
+
The preceding example assumes that you extracted the {prodname} SQL Server connector to the `/kafka/connect/{prodname}-connector-sqlserver` path.

. Restart your Kafka Connect process to ensure that it picks up the new JAR files.

You also need to {LinkDebeziumUserGuide}#setting-up-sqlserver[set up SQL Server] to run a {prodname} connector.

==== Example configuration

To use the connector to produce change events for a particular SQL Server database or cluster:

. Enable the {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#setting-up-sqlserver[CDC on SQL Server] to publish the _CDC_ events in the database.
. Create a configuration file for the SQL Server connector.

When the connector starts, it will create a consistent snapshot of the schemas in your SQL Server database and start streaming changes, producing change event records for every row in which data was inserted, updated, or deleted.
Optionally, you can configure the connector to produce change events for a subset of the schemas and tables in a database.
For example you can ignore, mask, or truncate columns that contain sensitive data, that are larger than a specified size, or that you do not need.

==== Adding connector configuration

ifdef::community[]
To run a {prodname} SQL Server connector, create a connector configuration and add the configuration to your Kafka Connect cluster. 

.Prerequisites

* SQL Server is set up to run a {prodname} connector.

* A {prodname} SQL Server connector is installed. 

.Procedure

. Create a configuration for the SQL Server connector.

. Use the link:{link-kafka-docs}/#connect_rest[Kafka Connect REST API] to add that connector configuration to your Kafka Connect cluster. 

endif::community[]

ifdef::product[]

You can use a provided {prodname} container to deploy a {prodname} SQL Server connector. 
In this procedure, you build a custom Kafka Connect container image for {prodname}, configure the {prodname} connector as needed, 
and then add your connector configuration to your Kafka Connect environment. 

.Prerequisites

* Podman or Docker is installed and you have sufficient rights to create and manage containers.
* You installed the {prodname} SQL Server connector archive. 

.Procedure

. Extract the {prodname} SQL Server connector archive to create a directory structure for the connector plug-in, for example: 
+
[subs=+macros]
----
pass:quotes[*tree ./my-plugins/*]
./my-plugins/
├── debezium-connector-sqlserver
│   ├── ...
----

. Create and publish a custom image for running your {prodname} connector:

.. Create a new `Dockerfile` by using `{DockerKafkaConnect}` as the base image. In the following example, you would replace _my-plugins_ with the name of your plug-ins directory:
+
[subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
FROM {DockerKafkaConnect}
USER root:root
pass:quotes[COPY _./my-plugins/_ /opt/kafka/plugins/]
USER 1001
----
+
Before Kafka Connect starts running the connector, Kafka Connect loads any third-party plug-ins that are in the `/opt/kafka/plugins` directory.

.. Build the container image. For example, if you saved the `Dockerfile` that you created in the previous step as `debezium-container-for-sqlserver`, and if the `Dockerfile` is in the current directory, then you would run the following command:
+
`podman build -t debezium-container-for-sqlserver:latest .`

.. Push your custom image to your container registry, for example:
+
`podman push debezium-container-for-sqlserver:latest`

.. Point to the new container image. Do one of the following:
+
* Edit the `spec.image` property of the `KafkaConnector` custom resource. If this property is set, it overrides the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE` variable in the Cluster Operator. For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaConnectApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnector
metadata:
  name: my-connect-cluster
spec:
  #...
  image: debezium-container-for-sqlserver
----
+
* In the `install/cluster-operator/050-Deployment-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml` file, edit the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE` variable to point to the new container image and reinstall the Cluster Operator. If you edit this file you must apply it to your OpenShift cluster.

. Create a `KafkaConnector` custom resource that defines your {prodname} SQL Server connector instance. See {LinkDebeziumUserGuide}#sqlserver-example-configuration[the connector configuration example].

. Apply the connector instance, for example: 
+
`oc apply -f inventory-connector.yaml`
+
This registers `inventory-connector` and the connector starts to run against the `inventory` database.

. Verify that the connector was created and has started to capture changes in the specified database. You can verify the connector instance by watching the Kafka Connect log output as, for example, `inventory-connector` starts.

.. Display the Kafka Connect log output:
+
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
oc logs $(oc get pods -o name -l strimzi.io/name=my-connect-cluster-connect)
----

.. Review the log output to verify that the initial snapshot has been executed. You should see something like the following lines: 
+
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
... INFO Starting snapshot for ...
... INFO Snapshot is using user 'debezium' ... 
----

endif::product[]

.Results

When the connector starts, it {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#sqlserver-snapshots[performs a consistent snapshot] of the SQL Server databases that the connector is configured for. The connector then starts generating data change events for row-level operations and streaming change event records to Kafka topics.

|An optional comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns that should be included in the change event message values.
Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _schemaName_._tableName_._columnName_.
Note that primary key columns are always included in the event's key, even if not included in the value.
Do not also set the `column.exclude.list` property.

|[[sqlserver-property-column-blacklist]]
[[sqlserver-property-column-exclude-list]]<<sqlserver-property-column-exclude-list, `column.exclude.list`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns that should be excluded from change event message values.
Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _schemaName_._tableName_._columnName_.
Note that primary key columns are always included in the event's key, also if excluded from the value.
Do not also set the `column.include.list` property.


|[[sqlserver-property-column-mask-hash]]<<sqlserver-property-column-mask-hash, `column.mask{zwsp}.hash._hashAlgorithm_{zwsp}.with.salt._salt_`>>
|_n/a_
|An optional comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of character-based columns whose values should be pseudonyms in the change event message values with a field value consisting of the hashed value using the algorithm `_hashAlgorithm_` and salt `_salt_`.
Based on the used hash function referential integrity is kept while data is pseudonymized. Supported hash functions are described in the {link-java7-standard-names}[MessageDigest section] of the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation.
The hash is automatically shortened to the length of the column.

Multiple properties with different lengths can be used in a single configuration, although in each the length must be a positive integer or zero. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _schemaName_._tableName_._columnName_.

Example:

    column.mask.hash.SHA-256.with.salt.CzQMA0cB5K = dbo.orders.customerName, dbo.shipment.customerName

where `CzQMA0cB5K` is a randomly selected salt.

Note: Depending on the `_hashAlgorithm_` used, the `_salt_` selected and the actual data set, the resulting masked data set may not be completely anonymized.

|[[sqlserver-property-time-precision-mode]]<<sqlserver-property-time-precision-mode, `time.precision{zwsp}.mode`>>
|`adaptive`
| Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precision, including: `adaptive` (the default) captures the time and timestamp values exactly as in the database using either millisecond, microsecond, or nanosecond precision values based on the database column's type; or `connect` always represents time and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision. See {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#sqlserver-temporal-values[temporal values].

|[[sqlserver-property-include-schema-changes]]<<sqlserver-property-include-schema-changes, `include.schema{zwsp}.changes`>>
|`true`
|Boolean value that specifies whether the connector should publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic with the same name as the database server ID. Each schema change is recorded with a key that contains the database name and a value that is a JSON structure that describes the schema update. This is independent of how the connector internally records database history. The default is `true`.

|[[sqlserver-property-tombstones-on-delete]]<<sqlserver-property-tombstones-on-delete, `tombstones.on{zwsp}.delete`>>
|`true`
| Controls whether a tombstone event should be generated after a delete event. +
When `true` the delete operations are represented by a delete event and a subsequent tombstone event. When `false` only a delete event is sent. +
Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted.

|[[sqlserver-property-column-truncate-to-length-chars]]<<sqlserver-property-column-truncate-to-length-chars, `column.truncate.to{zwsp}._length_.chars`>>
|_n/a_
|An optional comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of character-based columns whose values should be truncated in the change event message values if the field values are longer than the specified number of characters. Multiple properties with different lengths can be used in a single configuration, although in each the length must be a positive integer. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _schemaName_._tableName_._columnName_.

|[[sqlserver-property-column-mask-with-length-chars]]<<sqlserver-property-column-mask-with-length-chars, `column.mask.with{zwsp}._length_.chars`>>
|_n/a_
|An optional comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of character-based columns whose values should be replaced in the change event message values with a field value consisting of the specified number of asterisk (`*`) characters. Multiple properties with different lengths can be used in a single configuration, although in each the length must be a positive integer or zero. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _schemaName_._tableName_._columnName_.

|[[sqlserver-property-column-propagate-source-type]]<<sqlserver-property-column-propagate-source-type, `column.propagate{zwsp}.source.type`>>
|_n/a_
|An optional comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns whose original type and length should be added as a parameter to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change messages.
The schema parameters `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.type`, `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.length` and `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.scale` is used to propagate the original type name and length (for variable-width types), respectively.
Useful to properly size corresponding columns in sink databases.
Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _schemaName_._tableName_._columnName_.

|[[sqlserver-property-datatype-propagate-source-type]]<<sqlserver-property-datatype-propagate-source-type,`datatype.propagate{zwsp}.source.type`>>
|_n/a_
|An optional comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the database-specific data type name of columns whose original type and length should be added as a parameter to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change messages.
The schema parameters `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.type`, `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.length` and `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.scale` will be used to propagate the original type name and length (for variable-width types), respectively.
Useful to properly size corresponding columns in sink databases.
Fully-qualified data type names are of the form _schemaName_._tableName_._typeName_.
See {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#sqlserver-data-types[SQL Server data types] for the list of SQL Server-specific data type names.

|[[sqlserver-property-message-key-columns]]<<sqlserver-property-message-key-columns, `message.key.columns`>>
|_empty string_
| A semi-colon list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified tables and columns to map a primary key. +
Each item (regular expression) must match the fully-qualified `<fully-qualified table>:<a comma-separated list of columns>` representing the custom key. +
Fully-qualified tables could be defined as _schemaName_._tableName_.

|Property
|Default
|Description

|[[sqlserver-property-snapshot-mode]]<<sqlserver-property-snapshot-mode, `snapshot.mode`>>
|_initial_
|A mode for taking an initial snapshot of the structure and optionally data of captured tables.
Once the snapshot is complete, the connector will continue reading change events from the database's redo logs. +
 +
Supported values are: +
`initial`: Takes a snapshot of structure and data of captured tables; useful if topics should be populated with a complete representation of the data from the captured tables. +
`initial_only`: Takes a snapshot of structure and data like `initial` but instead does not transition into streaming changes once the snapshot has completed. +
`schema_only`: Takes a snapshot of the structure of captured tables only; useful if only changes happening from now onwards should be propagated to topics.

|[[sqlserver-property-snapshot-include-collection-list]]<<sqlserver-property-snapshot-include-collection-list, `snapshot.include.collection.list`>>
| All tables specified in `table.include.list`
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match names of schemas specified in `table.include.list` for which you *want* to take the snapshot.

|[[sqlserver-property-snapshot-isolation-mode]]<<sqlserver-property-snapshot-isolation-mode, `snapshot.isolation{zwsp}.mode`>>
|_repeatable_read_
|Mode to control which transaction isolation level is used and how long the connector locks tables that are designated for capture.
There are five possible values: `read_uncommitted`, `read_committed`, `repeatable_read`, `snapshot`, and `exclusive` (
in fact, `exclusive` mode uses repeatable read isolation level, however, it takes the exclusive lock on all tables
to be read). +

It is worth documenting that `snapshot`, `read_committed` and `read_uncommitted` modes do not prevent other
transactions from updating table rows during initial snapshot, while `exclusive` and `repeatable_read` do. +

Another aspect is data consistency. Only `exclusive` and `snapshot` modes guarantee full consistency, that is, initial
snapshot and streaming logs constitute a linear history.
In case of `repeatable_read` and `read_committed` modes, it might happen that, for instance, a record added appears
twice - once in initial snapshot and once in streaming phase. Nonetheless, that consistency level should do for
data mirroring.
For `read_uncommitted` there are no data consistency guarantees at all (some data might be lost or corrupted).

|[[sqlserver-property-source-timestamp-mode]]<<sqlserver-property-source-timestamp-mode, `source.timestamp{zwsp}.mode`>>
|_commit_
|String representing the criteria of the attached timestamp within the source record (ts_ms).
`commit` will set the source timestamp to the instant where the record was committed in the database (default and current behavior).
`processing` will set the source timestamp to the instant where the record was processed by {prodname}. This option could be used when either we want to set the top level `ts_ms` value here or when we want to skip the query to extract the timestamp of that LSN.

|[[sqlserver-property-event-processing-failure-handling-mode]]<<sqlserver-property-event-processing-failure-handling-mode, `event.processing{zwsp}.failure.handling{zwsp}.mode`>>
|`fail`
| Specifies how the connector should react to exceptions during processing of events.
`fail` will propagate the exception (indicating the offset of the problematic event), causing the connector to stop. +
`warn` will cause the problematic event to be skipped and the offset of the problematic event to be logged. +
`skip` will cause the problematic event to be skipped.

|[[sqlserver-property-poll-interval-ms]]<<sqlserver-property-poll-interval-ms, `poll.interval.ms`>>
|`1000`
|Positive integer value that specifies the number of milliseconds the connector should wait during each iteration for new change events to appear. Defaults to 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second.

|[[sqlserver-property-max-queue-size]]<<sqlserver-property-max-queue-size, `max.queue.size`>>
|`8192`
|Positive integer value that specifies the maximum size of the blocking queue into which change events read from the database log are placed before they are written to Kafka. This queue can provide backpressure to the CDC table reader when, for example, writes to Kafka are slower or if Kafka is not available. Events that appear in the queue are not included in the offsets periodically recorded by this connector. Defaults to 8192, and should always be larger than the maximum batch size specified in the `max.batch.size` property.

|[[sqlserver-property-max-batch-size]]<<sqlserver-property-max-batch-size, `max.batch.size`>>
|`2048`
|Positive integer value that specifies the maximum size of each batch of events that should be processed during each iteration of this connector. Defaults to 2048.

|[[sqlserver-property-heartbeat-interval-ms]]<<sqlserver-property-heartbeat-interval-ms, `heartbeat.interval{zwsp}.ms`>>
|`0`
|Controls how frequently heartbeat messages are sent. +
This property contains an interval in milliseconds that defines how frequently the connector sends messages to a heartbeat topic.
The property can be used to confirm whether the connector is still receiving change events from the database.
You also should leverage heartbeat messages in cases where only records in non-captured tables are changed for a longer period of time.
In such situation the connector would proceed to read the log from the database but never emit any change messages into Kafka,
which in turn means that no offset updates are committed to Kafka.
This may result in more change events to be re-sent after a connector restart.
Set this parameter to `0` to not send heartbeat messages at all. +
Disabled by default.

|[[sqlserver-property-heartbeat-topics-prefix]]<<sqlserver-property-heartbeat-topics-prefix, `heartbeat.topics{zwsp}.prefix`>>
|`__debezium-heartbeat`
|Controls the naming of the topic to which heartbeat messages are sent. +
The topic is named according to the pattern `<heartbeat.topics.prefix>.<server.name>`.

|[[sqlserver-property-snapshot-delay-ms]]<<sqlserver-property-snapshot-delay-ms, `snapshot.delay.ms`>>
|
|An interval in milli-seconds that the connector should wait before taking a snapshot after starting up; +
Can be used to avoid snapshot interruptions when starting multiple connectors in a cluster, which may cause re-balancing of connectors.

|[[sqlserver-property-snapshot-fetch-size]]<<sqlserver-property-snapshot-fetch-size, `snapshot.fetch.size`>>
|`2000`
|Specifies the maximum number of rows that should be read in one go from each table while taking a snapshot.
The connector will read the table contents in multiple batches of this size. Defaults to 2000.

|[[sqlserver-property-query-fetch-size]]<<sqlserver-property-query-fetch-size, `query.fetch.size`>>
|
|Specifies the number of rows that will be fetched for each database round-trip of a given query.
Defaults to the JDBC driver's default fetch size.

|[[sqlserver-property-snapshot-lock-timeout-ms]]<<sqlserver-property-snapshot-lock-timeout-ms, `snapshot.lock{zwsp}.timeout.ms`>>
|`10000`
|An integer value that specifies the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait to obtain table locks when performing a snapshot. If table locks cannot be acquired in this time interval, the snapshot will fail (also see {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#sqlserver-snapshots[snapshots]). +
When set to `0` the connector will fail immediately when it cannot obtain the lock. Value `-1` indicates infinite waiting.

|[[sqlserver-property-snapshot-select-statement-overrides]]<<sqlserver-property-snapshot-select-statement-overrides, `snapshot.select{zwsp}.statement{zwsp}.overrides`>>
|
|Controls which rows from tables are included in snapshot. +
This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables _(SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME)_. Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id `snapshot.select.statement.overrides.[SCHEMA_NAME].[TABLE_NAME]`. The value of those properties is the SELECT statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. _A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted._ +
*Note*: This setting has impact on snapshots only. Events captured during log reading are not affected by it.

ifdef::community[]
|[[sqlserver-property-source-struct-version]]<<sqlserver-property-source-struct-version, `source.struct.version`>>
|v2
|Schema version for the `source` block in CDC events; {prodname} 0.10 introduced a few breaking +
changes to the structure of the `source` block in order to unify the exposed structure across
all the connectors. +
By setting this option to `v1` the structure used in earlier versions can be produced.
Note that this setting is not recommended and is planned for removal in a future {prodname} version.
endif::community[]

|[[sqlserver-property-sanitize-field-names]]<<sqlserver-property-sanitize-field-names, `sanitize.field{zwsp}.names`>>
|`true` when connector configuration explicitly specifies the `key.converter` or `value.converter` parameters to use Avro, otherwise defaults to `false`.
|Whether field names are sanitized to adhere to Avro naming requirements.
ifdef::community[]
See {link-prefix}:{link-avro-serialization}#avro-naming[Avro naming] for more details.

|[[sqlserver-property-database-server-timezone]]<<sqlserver-property-database-server-timezone, `database.server{zwsp}.timezone`>>
|
| Timezone of the server.

This is used to define the timezone of the transaction timestamp (ts_ms) retrieved from the server (which is actually not zoned). Default value is unset. Should only be specified when running on SQL Server 2014 or older and using different timezones for the database server and the JVM running the {prodname} connector. +
When unset, default behavior is to use the timezone of the VM running the {prodname} connector. In this case, when running on on SQL Server 2014 or older and using different timezones on server and the connector, incorrect ts_ms values may be produced. +
Possible values include "Z", "UTC", offset values like "+02:00", short zone ids like "CET", and long zone ids like "Europe/Paris".

|[[sqlserver-property-provide-transaction-metadata]]<<sqlserver-property-provide-transaction-metadata, `provide.transaction{zwsp}.metadata`>>
|`false`
|When set to `true` {prodname} generates events with transaction boundaries and enriches data events envelope with transaction metadata.

See {link-prefix}:{link-sqlserver-connector}#sqlserver-transaction-metadata[Transaction Metadata] for additional details.

|[[sqlserver-property-retriable-restart-connector-wait-ms]]<<sqlserver-property-retriable-restart-connector-wait-ms, `retriable.restart{zwsp}.connector.wait.ms`>> +
|10000 (10 seconds)
|The number of milli-seconds to wait before restarting a connector after a retriable error occurs.

|===

The connector also supports _pass-through_ configuration properties that are used when creating the Kafka producer and consumer. Specifically, all connector configuration properties that begin with the `database.history.producer.` prefix are used (without the prefix) when creating the Kafka producer that writes to the database history, and all those that begin with the prefix `database.history.consumer.` are used (without the prefix) when creating the Kafka consumer that reads the database history upon connector startup.

For example, the following connector configuration properties can be used to {link-kafka-docs}.html#security_configclients[secure connections to the Kafka broker]:

In addition to the _pass-through_ to the Kafka producer and consumer, the properties starting with `database.`, e.g. `database.applicationName=debezium` are passed to the JDBC URL.

// Type: assembly
// ModuleID: refreshing-capture-tables-after-a-schema-change
// Title: Refreshing capture tables after a schema change 
[[sqlserver-schema-evolution]]
=== Database schema evolution

When change data capture is enabled for a SQL Server table, as changes occur in the table, event records are persisted to a capture table on the server.
If you introduce a change in the structure of the source table change, for example, by adding a new column, that change is not dynamically reflected in the change table.
For as long as the capture table continues to use the outdated schema, the {prodname} connector is unable to emit data change events for the table correctly.
You must intervene to refresh the capture table to enable the connector to resume processing change events.   
 
Because of the way that CDC is implemented in SQL Server, you cannot use {prodname} to update capture tables.
To refresh capture tables, one must be a SQL Server database operator with elevated privileges.
As a {prodname} user, you must coordinate tasks with the SQL Server database operator to complete the schema refresh and restore streaming to Kafka topics.    

You can use one of the following methods to update capture tables after a schema change:

* xref:offline-schema-updates[]. In offline schema updates, capture tables are updated after you stop the {prodname} connector.
* xref:online-schema-updates[]. In online schema updates, capture tables are updated while the {prodname} connector is running.

There are advantages and disadvantages to using each type of procedure.

[WARNING]
====
Whether you use the online or offline update method, you must complete the entire schema update process before you apply subsequent schema updates on the same source table.
The best practice is to execute all DDLs in a single batch so the procedure can be run only once.
====

[NOTE]
====
Some schema changes are not supported on source tables that have CDC enabled.
For example, if CDC is enabled on a table, SQL Server does not allow you to change the schema of the table if you renamed one of its columns or changed the column type.
====

[NOTE]
====
After you change a column in a source table from `NULL` to `NOT NULL` or vice versa, the SQL Server connector cannot correctly capture the changed information until after you create a new capture instance.
If you do not create a new capture table after a change to the column designation, change event records that the connector emits do not correctly indicate whether the column is optional.
That is, columns that were previously defined as optional (or `NULL`) continue to be, despite now being defined as `NOT NULL`. 
Similarly, columns that had been defined as required (`NOT NULL`), retain that designation, although they are now defined as `NULL`.
====

// Type: procedure
// ModuleID: debezium-sql-server-connector-running-an-offline-update-after-a-schema-change
// Title: Running an offline update after a schema change 
[id="offline-schema-updates"]
==== Offline schema updates

Offline schema updates provide the safest method for updating capture tables. 
However, offline updates might not be feasible for use with applications that require high-availability.

.Prerequisites
* An update was committed to the schema of a SQL Server table that has CDC enabled.
* You are a SQL Server database operator with elevated privileges.

.Procedure

1. Suspend the application that updates the database.
2. Wait for the {prodname} connector to stream all unstreamed change event records.
3. Stop the {prodname} connector.
4. Apply all changes to the source table schema.
5. Create a new capture table for the update source table using `sys.sp_cdc_enable_table` procedure with a unique value for parameter `@capture_instance`.
6. Resume the application that you suspended in Step 1.
7. Start the {prodname} connector.
8. After the {prodname} connector starts streaming from the new capture table, drop the old capture table by running the stored procedure `sys.sp_cdc_disable_table` with the parameter `@capture_instance` set to the old capture instance name.

// Type: procedure
// ModuleID: debezium-sql-server-connector-running-an-online-update-after-a-schema-change
// Title: Running an online update after a schema change 
[id="online-schema-updates"]
==== Online schema updates

The procedure for completing an online schema updates is simpler than the procedure for running an offline schema update, 
and you can complete it without requiring any downtime in application and data processing.
However, with online schema updates, a potential processing gap can occur after you update the schema in the source database, 
but before you create the new capture instance.
During that interval, change events continue to be captured by the old instance of the change table, Q
and the change data that is saved to the old table retains the structure of the earlier schema.
So, for example, if you added a new column to a source table, change events that are produced before the new capture table is ready, do not contain a field for the new column.
If your application does not tolerate such a transition period, it is best to use the offline schema update procedure.

.Prerequisites
* An update was committed to the schema of a SQL Server table that has CDC enabled.
* You are a SQL Server database operator with elevated privileges.

.Procedure
1. Apply all changes to the source table schema.
2. Create a new capture table for the update source table by running the `sys.sp_cdc_enable_table` stored procedure with a unique value for the parameter `@capture_instance`.
3. When {prodname} starts streaming from the new capture table, you can drop the old capture table by running the `sys.sp_cdc_disable_table` stored procedure with the parameter `@capture_instance` set to the old capture instance name.


.Example: Running an online schema update after a database schema change 
ifdef::community[]
Let's deploy the SQL Server based https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/tutorial#using-sql-server[{prodname} tutorial] to demonstrate the online schema update.

In the following example, a column `phone_number` is added to the `customers` table.

* <<sqlserver-snapshot-metrics, snapshot metrics>>; for monitoring the connector when performing snapshots.
* <<sqlserver-streaming-metrics, streaming metrics>>; for monitoring the connector when reading CDC table data.
* <<sqlserver-schema-history-metrics, schema history metrics>>; for monitoring the status of the connector's schema history.

For information about how to expose the preceding metrics through JMX, see the {link-prefix}:{link-debezium-monitoring}[{prodname} monitoring documentation].
