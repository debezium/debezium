MySQL has a binary log (binlog) that records all operations in the order in which they are committed to the database. This includes changes to table schemas as well as changes to the data in tables. MySQL uses the binlog for replication and recovery.

The {prodname} MySQL connector reads the binlog, produces change events for row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations, and emits the change events to Kafka topics. Client applications read those Kafka topics.

As MySQL is typically set up to purge binlogs after a specified period of time, the MySQL connector performs an initial _consistent snapshot_ of each of your databases. The MySQL connector reads the binlog from the point at which the snapshot was made.

== How the connector works

An overview of the MySQL topologies that the connector supports is useful for planning your application. To optimally configure and run a {prodname} MySQL connector, it is helpful to understand how the connector tracks the structure of tables, exposes schema changes, performs snapshots, and determines Kafka topic names.

[NOTE]
====
The {prodname} MySQL connector has been tested and officially supports MariaDB 11.1.2+.

// Type: concept
// ModuleID: mysql-topologies-supported-by-debezium-connectors
// Title: MySQL topologies supported by {prodname} connectors
[id="supported-mysql-topologies"]
=== Supported MySQL topologies

The {prodname} MySQL connector supports the following MySQL topologies:

Standalone::
When a single MySQL server is used, the server must have the binlog enabled (_and optionally GTIDs enabled_) so the {prodname} MySQL connector can monitor the server. This is often acceptable, since the binary log can also be used as an incremental link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/backup-methods.html[backup]. In this case, the MySQL connector always connects to and follows this standalone MySQL server instance.

Primary and replica::
The {prodname} MySQL connector can follow one of the primary servers or one of the replicas (_if that replica has its binlog enabled_), but the connector sees changes in only the cluster that is visible to that server. Generally, this is not a problem except for the multi-primary topologies.
+
The connector records its position in the server’s binlog, which is different on each server in the cluster. Therefore, the connector must follow just one MySQL server instance. If that server fails, that server must be restarted or recovered before the connector can continue.

High available clusters::
A variety of link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-ha-scalability/en/[high availability] solutions exist for MySQL, and they make it significantly easier to tolerate and almost immediately recover from problems and failures. Most HA MySQL clusters use GTIDs so that replicas are able to keep track of all changes on any of the primary servers.

Multi-primary::
link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/mysql-cluster-replication-multi-source.html[Network Database (NDB) cluster replication] uses one or more MySQL replica nodes that each replicate from multiple primary servers. This is a powerful way to aggregate the replication of multiple MySQL clusters. This topology requires the use of GTIDs.
+
A {prodname} MySQL connector can use these multi-primary MySQL replicas as sources, and can fail over to different multi-primary MySQL replicas as long as the new replica is caught up to the old replica. That is, the new replica has all transactions that were seen on the first replica. This works even if the connector is using only a subset of databases and/or tables, as the connector can be configured to include or exclude specific GTID sources when attempting to reconnect to a new multi-primary MySQL replica and find the correct position in the binlog.

Hosted::
There is support for the {prodname} MySQL connector to use hosted options such as Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora.
+
Because these hosted options do not allow a global read lock, table-level locks are used to create the _consistent snapshot_.

// ModuleID: supplemental-configuration-for-connecting-debezium-to-mariadb
// Title: Supplemental configuration for connecting {prodname} to a MariaDB database
[[mysql-mariadb-support]]
=== Using the connector with a MariaDB database

Although it is possible to use the MySQL driver to connect and stream changes from MariaDB, it's best to configure the {prodname} MySQL connector to use the MariaDB adapter mode, so that the connector can take advantage of the MariaDB driver, and its unique feature stack.
To toggle the MariaDB support mode, the xref:mysql-property-connector-adapter[`connector.adapter`] configuration property must be specified with a value of `mariadb`.
This mode utilizes the MariaDB driver instead of the MySQL driver, meaning that you must also provide the database protocol and JDBC driver strings that are compliant with MariaDB, see the example below.

.MariaDB supplemental configuration
[source,json]
----
{
  ...
  "connector.adapter": "mariadb",
  "database.protocol": "jdbc:mariadb",
  "database.jdbc.driver": "org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver"
}
----
ifdef::product[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Use of the {prodname} MySQL connector with MariaDB is a Technology Preview feature only.
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
Red{nbsp}Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red{nbsp}Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

endif::product[]
ifdef::community[]
[NOTE]
====
When the new {prodname} MariaDB connector is available in a future release, these supplemental configurations will no longer be necessary.
As the connector currently includes both the MySQL and MariaDB drivers, the MariaDB mode is _opt-in_ until {prodname} introduces the new MariaDB-specific connector.
====
endif::community[]
After you apply the Maria DB supplemental configuration, the {prodname} MySQL connector uses the MariaDB adapter connector, which natively streams changes from MariaDB binary transaction logs.
You can use all other xref:mysql-connector-properties[MySQL connector properties] in conjunction with the preceding supplemental configuration.

// Type: concept
// ModuleID: how-debezium-mysql-connectors-handle-database-schema-changes
// Title: How {prodname} MySQL connectors handle database schema changes
[[mysql-schema-history-topic]]
=== Schema history topic

When a database client queries a database, the client uses the database’s current schema.
However, the database schema can be changed at any time, which means that the connector must be able to identify what the schema was at the time each insert, update, or delete operation was recorded.
Also, a connector cannot necessarily apply the current schema to every event.
If an event is relatively old, it's possible that it was recorded before the current schema was applied.

To ensure correct processing of events that occur after a schema change, MySQL includes in the transaction log not only the row-level changes that affect the data, but also the DDL statements that are applied to the database.
As the connector encounters these DDL statements in the binlog, it parses them and updates an in-memory representation of each table’s schema.
The connector uses this schema representation to identify the structure of the tables at the time of each insert, update, or delete operation and to produce the appropriate change event.
In a separate database schema history Kafka topic, the connector records all DDL statements along with the position in the binlog where each DDL statement appeared.

When the connector restarts after either a crash or a graceful stop, it starts reading the binlog from a specific position, that is, from a specific point in time.
The connector rebuilds the table structures that existed at this point in time by reading the database schema history Kafka topic and parsing all DDL statements up to the point in the binlog where the connector is starting.

This database schema history topic is for internal connector use only.
Optionally, the connector can also xref:mysql-schema-change-topic[emit schema change events to a different topic that is intended for consumer applications].

When the MySQL connector captures changes in a table to which a schema change tool such as `gh-ost` or `pt-online-schema-change` is applied, there are helper tables created during the migration process.
You must configure the connector to capture changes that occur in these helper tables.
If consumers do not need the records the the connector generates for helper tables, configure a {link-prefix}:{link-filtering}#message-filtering[single message transform (SMT)] to remove these records from the messages that the connector emits.

// Type: concept
// ModuleID: how-debezium-mysql-connectors-expose-database-schema-changes
// Title: How {prodname} MySQL connectors expose database schema changes
[id="mysql-schema-change-topic"]
=== Schema change topic

You can configure a {prodname} MySQL connector to produce schema change events that describe schema changes that are applied to tables in the database.
The connector writes schema change events to a Kafka topic named `_<topicPrefix>_`, where `_topicPrefix_` is the namespace specified in the xref:mysql-property-topic-prefix[`topic.prefix`] connector configuration property.
Messages that the connector sends to the schema change topic contain a payload, and, optionally, also contain the schema of the change event message.

The schema for the schema change event has the following elements:

`name`:: The name of the schema change event message.
`type`:: The type of the change event message.
`version`:: The version of the schema. The version is an integer that is incremented each time the schema is changed.
`fields`:: The fields that are included in the change event message.

.Example: Schema of the MySQL connector schema change topic
The following example shows a typical schema in JSON format.

[source,json,indent=0,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "struct",
    "fields": [
      {
        "type": "string",
        "optional": false,
        "field": "databaseName"
      }
    ],
    "optional": false,
    "name": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.SchemaChangeKey",
    "version": 1
  },
  "payload": {
    "databaseName": "inventory"
  }
}
----

The payload of a schema change event message includes the following elements:

`ddl`:: Provides the SQL `CREATE`, `ALTER`, or `DROP` statement that results in the schema change.
`databaseName`:: The name of the database to which the DDL statements are applied.
The value of `databaseName` serves as the message key.
`pos`:: The position in the binlog where the statements appear.
`tableChanges`::  A structured representation of the entire table schema after the schema change.
The `tableChanges` field contains an array that includes entries for each column of the table.
Because the structured representation presents data in JSON or Avro format, consumers can easily read messages without first processing them through a DDL parser.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For a table that is in capture mode, the connector not only stores the history of schema changes in the schema change topic, but also in an internal database schema history topic.
The internal database schema history topic is for connector use only and it is not intended for direct use by consuming applications.
Ensure that applications that require notifications about schema changes consume that information only from the schema change topic.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Never partition the database schema history topic.
For the database schema history topic to function correctly, it must maintain a consistent, global order of the event records that the connector emits to it.

To ensure that the topic is not split among partitions, set the partition count for the topic by using one of the following methods:

* If you create the database schema history topic manually, specify a partition count of `1`.
* If you use the Apache Kafka broker to create the database schema history topic automatically, the topic is created, set the value of the link:{link-kafka-docs}/#brokerconfigs_num.partitions[Kafka `num.partitions`] configuration option to `1`.
====

[WARNING]
====
The format of the messages that a connector emits to its schema change topic is in an incubating state and is subject to change without notice.
====

.Example: Message emitted to the MySQL connector schema change topic
The following example shows a typical schema change message in JSON format.
The message contains a logical representation of the table schema.

.Descriptions of fields in messages emitted to the schema change topic
[cols="1,4,5",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`source`
|The `source` field is structured exactly as standard data change events that the connector writes to table-specific topics.
This field is useful to correlate events on different topics.

|2
|`ts_ms`, `ts_us`, `ts_ns`
|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event.
The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.

In the source object, ts_ms indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for payload.source.ts_ms with the value for payload.ts_ms, you can determine the lag between the source database update and Debezium.

|3
|`databaseName` +
`schemaName`
|Identifies the database and the schema that contains the change.
The value of the `databaseName` field is used as the message key for the record.

|4
|`ddl`
|This field contains the DDL that is responsible for the schema change.
The `ddl` field can contain multiple DDL statements.
Each statement applies to the database in the `databaseName` field.
Multiple DDL statements appear in the order in which they were applied to the database. +
 +
Clients can submit multiple DDL statements that apply to multiple databases.
If MySQL applies them atomically, the connector takes the DDL statements in order, groups them by database, and creates a schema change event for each group.
If MySQL applies them individually, the connector creates a separate schema change event for each statement.

|5
|`tableChanges`
|An array of one or more items that contain the schema changes generated by a DDL command.

|6
|`type`
a|Describes the kind of change. The value is one of the following:

`CREATE`:: Table created.
`ALTER`:: Table modified.
`DROP`:: Table deleted.

|7
|`id`
|Full identifier of the table that was created, altered, or dropped.
In the case of a table rename, this identifier is a concatenation of `_<old>_,_<new>_` table names.

|8
|`table`
|Represents table metadata after the applied change.

|9
|`primaryKeyColumnNames`
|List of columns that compose the table's primary key.

|10
|`columns`
|Metadata for each column in the changed table.

|11
|`attributes`
|Custom attribute metadata for each table change.

// Type: concept
// Title: How {prodname} MySQL connectors perform database snapshots
// ModuleID: how-debezium-mysql-connectors-perform-database-snapshots
[[mysql-snapshots]]
=== Snapshots

When a {prodname} MySQL connector is first started, it performs an initial _consistent snapshot_ of your database.
This snapshot enables the connector to establish a baseline for the current state of the database.

{prodname} can use different modes when it runs a snapshot.
The snapshot mode is determined by the xref:mysql-property-snapshot-mode[`snapshot.mode`] configuration property.
The default value of the property is `initial`.
You can customize the way that the connector creates snapshots by changing the value of the `snapshot.mode` property.

ifdef::product[]
You can find more information about snapshots in the following sections:

* xref:debezium-mysql-ad-hoc-snapshots[]
* xref:debezium-mysql-incremental-snapshots[]
endif::product[]


The connector completes a series of tasks when it performs the snapshot.
The exact steps vary with the snapshot mode and with the table locking policy that is in effect for the database.
The {prodname} MySQL connector completes different steps when it performs an initial snapshot that uses a xref:initial-snapshot-workflow-with-global-read-lock[global read lock] or xref:initial-snapshot-workflow-with-table-level-locks[table-level locks].

// Type: concept
// ModuleID: debezium-mysql-description-of-the-workflow-for-initial-snapshots-that-use-a-global-read-lock
[id="initial-snapshot-workflow-with-global-read-lock"]
==== Initial snapshots that use a global read lock

You can customize the way that the connector creates snapshots by changing the value of the `snapshot.mode` property.
If you configure a different snapshot mode, the connector completes the snapshot by using a modified version of this workflow.
For information about the snapshot process in environments that do not permit global read locks, see the xref:snapshot-workflow-with-table-level-locks[snapshot workflow for table-level locks].

.Default workflow that the {prodname} MySQL connector uses to perform an initial snapshot with a global read lock
The following table shows the steps in the workflow that {prodname} follows to create a snapshot with a global read lock.

[cols="1a,9a",options="header",subs="+attributes"]
|===
|Step |Action

|1
a|Establish a connection to the database.

|2
|Determine the tables to be captured.
By default, the connector captures the data for all non-system tables.
After the snapshot completes, the connector continues to stream data for the specified tables.
If you want the connector to capture data only from specific tables you can direct the connector to capture the data for only a subset of tables or table elements by setting properties such as xref:{context}-property-table-include-list[`table.include.list`] or xref:{context}-property-table-exclude-list[`table.exclude.list`].

|3
|Obtain a global read lock on the tables to be captured to block _writes_ by other database clients. +

The snapshot itself does not prevent other clients from applying DDL that might interfere with the connector's attempt to read the binlog position and table schemas.
The connector retains the global read lock while it reads the binlog position, and releases the lock as described in a later step.

|4
a|Start a transaction with link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/innodb-consistent-read.html[repeatable read semantics] to ensure that all subsequent reads within the transaction are done against the _consistent snapshot_. +
 +
[NOTE]
====
The use of these isolation semantics can slow the progress of the snapshot.
If the snapshot takes too long to complete, consider using a different isolation configuration, or skip the initial snapshot and run an xref:debezium-mysql-incremental-snapshots[incremental snapshot] instead.
====

|5
|Read the current binlog position.

|6
a|Capture the structure of all tables in the database, or all tables that are designated for capture.
The connector persists schema information in its internal database schema history topic, including all necessary `DROP...` and `CREATE...` DDL statements. +
The schema history provides information about the structure that is in effect when a change event occurs.
 +
[NOTE]
====
By default, the connector captures the schema of every table in the database, including tables that are not configured for capture.
If tables are not configured for capture, the initial snapshot captures only their structure; it does not capture any table data.

For more information about why snapshots persist schema information for tables that you did not include in the initial snapshot, see xref:understanding-why-initial-snapshots-capture-the-schema-history-for-all-tables[Understanding why initial snapshots capture the schema for all tables].
====

|7
|Release the global read lock obtained in Step 3.
Other database clients can now write to the database.

|8
a|At the binlog position that the connector read in Step 5, the connector begins to scan the tables that are designated for capture.
  During the scan, the connector completes the following tasks:

. Confirms that the table was created before the snapshot began.

|===

The resulting initial snapshot captures the current state of each row in the captured tables.
From this baseline state, the connector captures subsequent changes as they occur.

After the snapshot process begins, if the process is interrupted due to connector failure, rebalancing, or other reasons, the process restarts after the connector restarts.

After the connector completes the initial snapshot, it continues streaming from the position that it read in Step 5 so that it does not miss any updates.

If the connector stops again for any reason, after it restarts, it resumes streaming changes from where it previously left off.

After the connector restarts, if the logs have been pruned, the connector's position in the logs might no longer available.
The connector then fails, and returns an error that indicates that a new snapshot is required.
To configure the connector to automatically initiate a snapshot in this situation, set the value of the xref:{context}-property-snapshot-mode[`snapshot.mode`] property to `when_needed`.

==== Initial snapshots that use table-level locks

In some database environments administrators do not permit global read locks.
If the {prodname} MySQL connector detects that global read locks are not permitted, the connector uses table-level locks when it performs snapshots.
For the connector to perform a snapshot that uses table-level locks, the database account that the {prodname} connector uses to connect to MySQL must have `LOCK TABLES` privileges.

.Default workflow that the {prodname} MySQL connector uses to perform an initial snapshot with table-level locks
The following workflow lists the steps that {prodname} takes to create a snapshot with table-level read locks.
For information about the snapshot process in environments that do not permit global read locks, see the xref:initial-snapshot-workflow-with-global-read-lock[snapshot workflow for global read locks].

|===
|Step |Action

|1
|Establish a connection to the database.

|2
|Determine the tables to be captured.
By default, the connector captures all non-system tables.
To have the connector capture a subset of tables or table elements, you can set a number of `include` and `exclude` properties to filter the data, for example, xref:mysql-property-table-include-list[`table.include.list`] or xref:mysql-property-table-exclude-list[`table.exclude.list`].

|3
|Obtain table-level locks.

|4
a|Start a transaction with link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/innodb-consistent-read.html[repeatable read semantics] to ensure that all subsequent reads within the transaction are done against the _consistent snapshot_.

//  |5
//  |Read and filter the names of the databases and tables.

|5
a|Read the current binlog position.

|6
a|Read the schema of the databases and tables for which the connector is configured to capture changes.
The connector persists schema information in its internal database schema history topic, including all necessary `DROP...` and `CREATE...` DDL statements. +
The schema history provides information about the structure that is in effect when a change event occurs.
 +
[NOTE]
====
By default, the connector captures the schema of every table in the database, including tables that are not configured for capture.
If tables are not configured for capture, the initial snapshot captures only their structure; it does not capture any table data.

For more information about why snapshots persist schema information for tables that you did not include in the initial snapshot, see xref:understanding-why-initial-snapshots-capture-the-schema-history-for-all-tables[Understanding why initial snapshots capture the schema for all tables].
====

|7
a|At the binlog position that the connector read in Step 5, the connector begins to scan the tables that are designated for capture.
  During the scan, the connector completes the following tasks:

. Confirms that the table was created before the snapshot began.
   If the table was created after the snapshot began, the connector skips the table.
   After the snapshot is complete, and the connector transitions to streaming, it emits change events for any tables that were created after the snapshot began.
. Produces a `read` event for each row that is captured from a table.
   All `read` events contain the same binlog position, which is the position that was obtained in step 5.
. Emits each `read` event to the Kafka topic for the source table.
. Releases data table locks, if applicable.

a|Commit the transaction.

// Type: concept
[id="understanding-why-initial-snapshots-capture-the-schema-history-for-all-tables"]
==== Understanding why initial snapshots capture the schema history for all tables

The initial snapshot that a connector runs captures two types of information:

Table data::
Information about `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations in tables that are named in the connector's xref:{context}-property-table-include-list[`table.include.list`] property.
Schema data::
DDL statements that describe the structural changes that are applied to tables.
Schema data is persisted to both the internal schema history topic, and to the connector's schema change topic, if one is configured.

After you run an initial snapshot, you might notice that the snapshot captures schema information for tables that are not designated for capture.
By default, initial snapshots are designed to capture schema information for every table that is present in the database, not only from tables that are designated for capture.
Connectors require that the table's schema is present in the schema history topic before they can capture a table.
By enabling the initial snapshot to capture schema data for tables that are not part of the original capture set, {prodname} prepares the connector to readily capture event data from these tables should that later become necessary.
If the initial snapshot does not capture a table's schema, you must add the schema to the history topic before the connector can capture data from the table.

In some cases, you might want to limit schema capture in the initial snapshot.
This can be useful when you want to reduce the time required to complete a snapshot.
Or when {prodname} connects to the database instance through a user account that has access to multiple logical databases, but you want the connector to capture changes only from tables in a specific logic database.

// Type: procedure
[id="mysql-capturing-data-from-tables-not-captured-by-the-initial-snapshot-no-schema-change"]
==== Capturing data from tables not captured by the initial snapshot (no schema change)

In some cases, you might want the connector to capture data from a table whose schema was not captured by the initial snapshot.
Depending on the connector configuration, the initial snapshot might capture the table schema only for specific tables in the database.
If the table schema is not present in the history topic, the connector fails to capture the table, and reports a missing schema error.

You might still be able to capture data from the table, but you must perform additional steps to add the table schema.

.Prerequisites

* You want to capture data from a table with a schema that the connector did not capture during the initial snapshot.
* In the transaction log, all entries for the table use the same schema.
For information about capturing data from a new table that has undergone structural changes, see xref:mysql-capturing-data-from-new-tables-with-schema-changes[Capturing data from tables not captured by the initial snapshot (schema change)].

.Procedure

1. Stop the connector.
2. Remove the internal database schema history topic that is specified by the xref:{context}-property-database-history-kafka-topic[`schema.history.internal.kafka.topic property`].
3. Apply the following changes to the connector configuration:
.. Set the xref:{context}-property-snapshot-mode[`snapshot.mode`] to `schema_only_recovery`.
.. Set the value of xref:{context}-property-database-history-store-only-captured-tables-ddl[`schema.history.internal.store.only.captured.tables.ddl`] to `false`.
.. Add the tables that you want the connector to capture to `table.include.list`.
This guarantees that in the future, the connector can reconstruct the schema history for all tables.
4. Restart the connector.
The snapshot recovery process rebuilds the schema history based on the current structure of the tables.
5. (Optional) After the snapshot completes, initiate an xref:debezium-mysql-incremental-snapshots[incremental snapshot] to capture existing data for newly added tables along with changes to other tables that occurred while that connector was off-line.
6. (Optional) Reset the `snapshot.mode` back to `schema_only` to prevent the connector from initiating recovery after a future restart.

// Type: procedure
[id="mysql-capturing-data-from-new-tables-with-schema-changes"]
==== Capturing data from tables not captured by the initial snapshot (schema change)

If a schema change is applied to a table, records that are committed before the schema change have different structures than those that were committed after the change.
When {prodname} captures data from a table, it reads the schema history to ensure that it applies the correct schema to each event.
If the schema is not present in the schema history topic, the connector is unable to capture the table, and an error results.

If you want to capture data from a table that was not captured by the initial snapshot, and the schema of the table was modified, you must add the schema to the history topic, if it is not already available.
You can add the schema by running a new schema snapshot, or by running an initial snapshot for the table.

.Prerequisites
* You want to capture data from a table with a schema that the connector did not capture during the initial snapshot.
* A schema change was applied to the table so that the records to be captured do not have a uniform structure.

.Procedure

Initial snapshot captured the schema for all tables (`store.only.captured.tables.ddl` was set to `false`)::
1. Edit the xref:{context}-property-table-include-list[`table.include.list`] property to specify the tables that you want to capture.
2. Restart the connector.
3. Initiate an xref:debezium-mysql-incremental-snapshots[incremental snapshot] if you want to capture existing data from the newly added tables.

Initial snapshot did not capture the schema for all tables (`store.only.captured.tables.ddl` was set to `true`)::
If the initial snapshot did not save the schema of the table that you want to capture, complete one of the following procedures:

Procedure 1: Schema snapshot, followed by incremental snapshot:::
In this procedure, the connector first performs a schema snapshot.
You can then initiate an incremental snapshot to enable the connector to synchronize data.
1. Stop the connector.
2. Remove the internal database schema history topic that is specified by the xref:{context}-property-database-history-kafka-topic[`schema.history.internal.kafka.topic property`].
3. Clear the offsets in the configured Kafka Connect link:{link-kafka-docs}/#connectconfigs_offset.storage.topic[`offset.storage.topic`].
For more information about how to remove offsets, see the link:https://debezium.io/documentation/faq/#how_to_remove_committed_offsets_for_a_connector[{prodname} community FAQ].
+
[WARNING]
====
Removing offsets should be performed only by advanced users who have experience in manipulating internal Kafka Connect data.
This operation is potentially destructive, and should be performed only as a last resort.
====
4. Set values for properties in the connector configuration as described in the following steps:
.. Set the value of the xref:{context}-property-snapshot-mode[`snapshot.mode`] property to `schema_only`.
.. Edit the xref:{context}-property-table-include-list[`table.include.list`] to add the tables that you want to capture.
5. Restart the connector.
6. Wait for {prodname} to capture the schema of the new and existing tables.
Data changes that occurred any tables after the connector stopped are not captured.
7. To ensure that no data is lost, initiate an xref:debezium-mysql-incremental-snapshots[incremental snapshot].

Procedure 2: Initial snapshot, followed by optional incremental snapshot:::
In this procedure the connector performs a full initial snapshot of the database.
As with any initial snapshot, in a database with many large tables, running an initial snapshot can be a time-consuming operation.
After the snapshot completes, you can optionally trigger an incremental snapshot to capture any changes that occur while the connector is off-line.

1. Stop the connector.
2. Remove the internal database schema history topic that is specified by the xref:{context}-property-database-history-kafka-topic[`schema.history.internal.kafka.topic property`].
3. Clear the offsets in the configured Kafka Connect link:{link-kafka-docs}/#connectconfigs_offset.storage.topic[`offset.storage.topic`].

+
[WARNING]
====

This operation is potentially destructive, and should be performed only as a last resort.
====
4. Edit the xref:{context}-property-table-include-list[`table.include.list`] to add the tables that you want to capture.
5. Set values for properties in the connector configuration as described in the following steps:
.. Set the value of the xref:{context}-property-snapshot-mode[`snapshot.mode`] property to `initial`.
.. (Optional) Set xref:{context}-property-database-history-store-only-captured-tables-ddl[`schema.history.internal.store.only.captured.tables.ddl`] to `false`.
6. Restart the connector.
The connector takes a full database snapshot.
After the snapshot completes, the connector transitions to streaming.
7. (Optional) To capture any data that changed while the connector was off-line, initiate an xref:debezium-mysql-incremental-snapshots[incremental snapshot].

[id="mysql-read-only-incremental-snapshots"]
==== Read-only incremental snapshots

The MySQL connector allows for running incremental snapshots with a read-only connection to the database.
To run an incremental snapshot with read-only access, the connector uses the executed global transaction IDs (GTID) set as high and low watermarks.
The state of a chunk's window is updated by comparing the GTIDs of binary log (binlog) events or the server's heartbeats against low and high watermarks.

To switch to a read-only implementation, set the value of the xref:mysql-property-read-only[`read.only`] property to `true`.

.Prerequisites

* xref:enable-mysql-gtids[Enable MySQL GTIDs].
* If the connector reads from a multi-threaded replica (that is, a replica for which the value of `replica_parallel_workers` is greater than `0`)
you must set one of the following options:

** `replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`
** `slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`

==== Ad hoc read-only incremental snapshots

When the MySQL connection is read-only, you can use any of the {link-prefix}:{link-signalling}#sending-signals-to-a-debezium-connector[available signaling channels] without the requirement to use the `source` channel.

// Type: continue
[id="mysql-snapshot-events"]
=== Operation type of snapshot events

The MySQL connector emits snapshot events as `READ` operations `("op" : "r")`.
If you prefer that the connector emits snapshot events as `CREATE` (`c`) events, configure the {prodname} `ReadToInsertEvent` single message transform (SMT) to modify the event type.

The following example shows how to configure the SMT:

// Title: Default names of Kafka topics that receive {prodname} MySQL change event records
[[mysql-topic-names]]
=== Topic names

By default, the MySQL connector writes change events for all of the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations that occur in a table to a single Apache Kafka topic that is specific to that table.

The connector uses the following convention to name change event topics:

_topicPrefix.databaseName.tableName_

Suppose that `fulfillment` is the topic prefix, `inventory` is the database name, and the database contains tables named `orders`, `customers`, and `products`.
The {prodname} MySQL connector emits events to three Kafka topics, one for each table in the database:

----
fulfillment.inventory.orders
fulfillment.inventory.customers
fulfillment.inventory.products
----

The following list provides definitions for the components of the default name:

_topicPrefix_:: The topic prefix as specified by the xref:mysql-property-topic-prefix[`topic.prefix`] connector configuration property.

_schemaName_:: The name of the schema in which the operation occurred.

_tableName_:: The name of the table in which the operation occurred.

The connector applies similar naming conventions to label its internal database schema history topics, xref:mysql-schema-change-topic[schema change topics], and xref:mysql-transaction-metadata[transaction metadata topics].

If the default topic name do not meet your requirements, you can configure custom topic names.
To configure custom topic names, you specify regular expressions in the logical topic routing SMT.
For more information about using the logical topic routing SMT to customize topic naming, see {link-prefix}:{link-topic-routing}#topic-routing[Topic routing].

[[mysql-transaction-metadata]]
=== Transaction metadata

{prodname} can generate events that represent transaction boundaries and that enrich data change event messages.

[NOTE]
.Limits on when {prodname} receives transaction metadata
====
{prodname} registers and receives metadata only for transactions that occur after you deploy the connector.
Metadata for transactions that occur before you deploy the connector is not available.
====

{prodname} generates transaction boundary events for the `BEGIN` and `END` delimiters in every transaction.
Transaction boundary events contain the following fields:

`status`:: `BEGIN` or `END`.
`id`:: String representation of the unique transaction identifier.
`ts_ms`:: The time of a transaction boundary event (`BEGIN` or `END` event) at the data source.
If the data source does not provide {prodname} with the event time, then the field instead represents the time at which {prodname} processes the event.
`event_count` (for `END` events):: Total number of events emitted by the transaction.
`data_collections` (for `END` events):: An array of pairs of `data_collection` and `event_count` elements that indicates the number of events that the connector emits for changes that originate from a data collection.

.Example

[source,json,indent=0,subs="+attributes"]

{
  "status": "BEGIN",
  "id": "0e4d5dcd-a33b-11ea-80f1-02010a22a99e:10",

    },
    {
      "data_collection": "s2.a",
      "event_count": 1
    }
  ]
}
----

Unless overridden via the xref:mysql-property-topic-transaction[`topic.transaction`] option,
the connector emits transaction events to the xref:mysql-property-topic-prefix[`_<topic.prefix>_`]`.transaction` topic.

.Change data event enrichment

When transaction metadata is enabled the data message `Envelope` is enriched with a new `transaction` field.
This field provides information about every event in the form of a composite of fields:

`id`:: String representation of unique transaction identifier.
`total_order`:: The absolute position of the event among all events generated by the transaction.
`data_collection_order`:: The per-data collection position of the event among all events that were emitted by the transaction.

Following is an example of a message:

[source,json,indent=0,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
  "before": null,
  "after": {
    "pk": "2",
    "aa": "1"
  },
  "source": {
...
  },
  "op": "c",
  "ts_ms": "1580390884335",
  "ts_us": "1580390884335472",
  "ts_ns": "1580390884335472987",
  "transaction": {
    "id": "0e4d5dcd-a33b-11ea-80f1-02010a22a99e:10",
    "total_order": "1",
    "data_collection_order": "1"
  }
}
----

For systems which don't have GTID enabled, the transaction identifier is constructed using the combination of binlog filename and binlog position. For example, if the binlog filename and position corresponding to the transaction BEGIN event are mysql-bin.000002 and 1913 respectively then the {prodname} constructed transaction identifier would be `file=mysql-bin.000002,pos=1913`.

// Type: assembly
// ModuleID: descriptions-of-debezium-mysql-connector-data-change-events
// Title: Descriptions of {prodname} MySQL connector data change events
[[mysql-events]]
== Data change events

The {prodname} MySQL connector generates a data change event for each row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operation. Each event contains a key and a value. The structure of the key and the value depends on the table that was changed.

{prodname} and Kafka Connect are designed around _continuous streams of event messages_. However, the structure of these events may change over time, which can be difficult for consumers to handle. To address this, each event contains the schema for its content or, if you are using a schema registry, a schema ID that a consumer can use to obtain the schema from the registry. This makes each event self-contained.

The following skeleton JSON shows the basic four parts of a change event. However, how you configure the Kafka Connect converter that you choose to use in your application determines the representation of these four parts in change events. A `schema` field is in a change event only when you configure the converter to produce it. Likewise, the event key and event payload are in a change event only if you configure a converter to produce it. If you use the JSON converter and you configure it to produce all four basic change event parts, change events have this structure:

[source,json,index=0]
----
{
 "schema": { //<1>
   ...
  },
 "payload": { //<2>
   ...
 },
 "schema": { //<3>
   ...
 },
 "payload": { //<4>
   ...
 },
}

|The second `payload` field is part of the event value. It has the structure described by the previous `schema` field and it contains the actual data for the row that was changed.

|===

By default, the connector streams change event records to topics with names that are the same as the event's originating table. See xref:mysql-topic-names[topic names].

[WARNING]
====
The MySQL connector ensures that all Kafka Connect schema names adhere to the link:http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#names[Avro schema name format]. This means that the logical server name must start with a Latin letter or an underscore, that is, a-z, A-Z, or pass:[_]. Each remaining character in the logical server name and each character in the database and table names must be a Latin letter, a digit, or an underscore, that is, a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or pass:[_]. If there is an invalid character it is replaced with an underscore character.

This can lead to unexpected conflicts if the logical server name, a database name, or a table name contains invalid characters, and the only characters that distinguish names from one another are invalid and thus replaced with underscores.

=== Change event keys

A change event's key contains the schema for the changed table's key and the changed row's actual key. Both the schema and its corresponding payload contain a field for each column in the changed table's `PRIMARY KEY` (or unique constraint) at the time the connector created the event.

Consider the following `customers` table, which is followed by an example of a change event key for this table.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY
) AUTO_INCREMENT=1001;
----

Every change event that captures a change to the `customers` table has the same event key schema. For as long as the `customers` table has the previous definition, every change event that captures a change to the `customers` table has the following key structure. In JSON, it looks like this:

[source,json,index=0]
----
{
 "schema": { <1>
    "type": "struct",
    "name": "mysql-server-1.inventory.customers.Key", <2>
    "optional": false, <3>
    "fields": [ <4>
      {
        "field": "id",
        "type": "int32",
        "optional": false
      }
    ]
  },
 "payload": { <5>
    "id": 1001
  }
}

.Description of change event key
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`schema`
|The schema portion of the key specifies a Kafka Connect schema that describes what is in the key's `payload` portion.

|2
|`mysql-server-1.inventory.customers.Key`
a|Name of the schema that defines the structure of the key's payload. This schema describes the structure of the primary key for the table that was changed. Key schema names have the format _connector-name_._database-name_._table-name_.`Key`. In this example: +

* `mysql-server-1` is the name of the connector that generated this event. +
* `inventory` is the database that contains the table that was changed. +
* `customers` is the table that was updated.

|3
|`optional`
|Indicates whether the event key must contain a value in its `payload` field. In this example, a value in the key's payload is required. A value in the key's payload field is optional when a table does not have a primary key.

|4
|`fields`
|Specifies each field that is expected in the `payload`, including each field's name, type, and whether it is required.

|5
|`payload`
|Contains the key for the row for which this change event was generated. In this example, the key, contains a single `id` field whose value is `1001`.

// Title: About values in {prodname} MySQL change events
[[mysql-change-event-values]]
=== Change event values

The value in a change event is a bit more complicated than the key. Like the key, the value has a `schema` section and a `payload` section. The `schema` section contains the schema that describes the `Envelope` structure of the `payload` section, including its nested fields. Change events for operations that create, update or delete data all have a value payload with an envelope structure.

Consider the same sample table that was used to show an example of a change event key:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY
) AUTO_INCREMENT=1001;
----

The value portion of a change event for a change to this table is described for:

* <<mysql-create-events,_create_ events>>
* <<mysql-update-events,_update_ events>>
* <<mysql-primary-key-updates,Primary key updates>>
* <<mysql-delete-events,_delete_ events>>
* <<mysql-tombstone-events,Tombstone events>>
* <<mysql-truncate-events,_truncate_ events>>

// Type: continue

=== _create_ events

.Descriptions of _create_ event value fields
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`schema`
|The value's schema, which describes the structure of the value's payload. A change event's value schema is the same in every change event that the connector generates for a particular table.

|2
|`name`
a|In the `schema` section, each `name` field specifies the schema for a field in the value's payload. +
 +
`mysql-server-1.inventory.customers.Value` is the schema for the payload's `before` and `after` fields. This schema is specific to the `customers` table. +
 +
Names of schemas for `before` and `after` fields are of the form `_logicalName_._tableName_.Value`, which ensures that the schema name is unique in the database.
This means that when using the {link-prefix}:{link-avro-serialization}#avro-serialization[Avro converter], the resulting Avro schema for each table in each logical source has its own evolution and history.

|3
|`name`
|`io.debezium.connector.mysql.Source` is the schema for the payload's `source` field. This schema is specific to the MySQL connector. The connector uses it for all events that it generates.

|4
|`name`
|`mysql-server-1.inventory.customers.Envelope` is the schema for the overall structure of the payload, where `mysql-server-1` is the connector name, `inventory` is the database, and `customers` is the table.

|5
|`payload`
|The value's actual data. This is the information that the change event is providing. +
 +
It may appear that the JSON representations of the events are much larger than the rows they describe. This is because the JSON representation must include the schema and the payload portions of the message.
However, by using the {link-prefix}:{link-avro-serialization}#avro-serialization[Avro converter], you can significantly decrease the size of the messages that the connector streams to Kafka topics.

|6
|`op`
a| Mandatory string that describes the type of operation that caused the connector to generate the event. In this example, `c` indicates that the operation created a row. Valid values are:

* `c` = create
* `u` = update
* `d` = delete
* `r` = read (applies to only snapshots)

|7
|`ts_ms`, `ts_us`, `ts_ns`
a| Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event.
The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.  +
 +
In the `source` object, `ts_ms` indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for `payload.source.ts_ms` with the value for `payload.ts_ms`, you can determine the lag between the source database update and {prodname}.

|8
|`before`
| An optional field that specifies the state of the row before the event occurred. When the `op` field is `c` for create, as it is in this example, the `before` field is `null` since this change event is for new content.

|9
|`after`
| An optional field that specifies the state of the row after the event occurred. In this example, the `after` field contains the values of the new row's `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` columns.

|10
|`source`
a| Mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event. This field contains information that you can use to compare this event with other events, with regard to the origin of the events, the order in which the events occurred, and whether events were part of the same transaction. The source metadata includes:

* {prodname} version
* Connector name
* binlog name where the event was recorded
* binlog position
* Row within the event
* If the event was part of a snapshot
* Name of the database and table that contain the new row
* ID of the MySQL thread that created the event (non-snapshot only)
* MySQL server ID (if available)
* Timestamp for when the change was made in the database

If the xref:enable-query-log-events[`MariaDB`] MySQL configuration option is enabled and the connector configuration `include.query` property is enabled, the `source` field also provides the `query` field, which contains the original SQL statement that caused the change event.
On MariaDB, the configuration option is `binlog_annotate_row_events`.

[id="mysql-update-events"]
=== _update_ events

The value of a change event for an update in the sample `customers` table has the same schema as a _create_ event for that table. Likewise, the event value's payload has the same structure. However, the event value payload contains different values in an _update_ event. Here is an example of a change event value in an event that the connector generates for an update in the `customers` table:

  }
}
----

.Descriptions of _update_ event value fields
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`before`
|An optional field that specifies the state of the row before the event occurred. In an _update_ event value, the `before` field contains a field for each table column and the value that was in that column before the database commit. In this example, the `first_name` value is `Anne.`

|2
|`after`
| An optional field that specifies the state of the row after the event occurred. You can compare the `before` and `after` structures to determine what the update to this row was. In the example, the `first_name` value is now `Anne Marie`.

|3
|`source`
a|Mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event. The `source` field structure has the same fields as in a _create_ event, but some values are different, for example, the sample _update_ event is from a different position in the binlog. The source metadata includes:

* {prodname} version
* Connector name
* binlog name where the event was recorded
* binlog position
* Row within the event
* If the event was part of a snapshot
* Name of the database and table that contain the updated row
* ID of the MySQL thread that created the event (non-snapshot only)
* MySQL server ID (if available)
* Timestamp for when the change was made in the database

If the xref:enable-query-log-events[`binlog_rows_query_log_events`] MySQL configuration option is enabled and the connector configuration `include.query` property is enabled, the `source` field also provides the `query` field, which contains the original SQL statement that caused the change event.
On MariaDB, the configuration option is `binlog_annotate_row_events`.

|4
|`op`
a|Mandatory string that describes the type of operation. In an _update_ event value, the `op` field value is `u`, signifying that this row changed because of an update.

|5
|`ts_ms`
a| Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event.
The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.  +
 +
In the `source` object, `ts_ms` indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for `payload.source.ts_ms` with the value for `payload.ts_ms`, you can determine the lag between the source database update and {prodname}.

|6
|`ts_us`
a|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event, in microseconds.
The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.

|7
|`ts_ns`
a|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event, in nanoseconds.
The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.

|===

[NOTE]
====
Updating the columns for a row's primary/unique key changes the value of the row's key. When a key changes, {prodname} outputs _three_ events: a `DELETE` event and a xref:mysql-tombstone-events[tombstone event] with the old key for the row, followed by an event with the new key for the row. Details are in the next section.
====

// Type: continue
[id="mysql-primary-key-updates"]
=== Primary key updates

An `UPDATE` operation that changes a row's primary key field(s) is known
as a primary key change. For a primary key change, in place of an `UPDATE` event record, the connector emits a `DELETE` event record for the old key and a `CREATE` event record for the new (updated) key. These events have the usual structure and content, and in addition, each one has a message header related to the primary key change:

* The `DELETE` event record has `__debezium.newkey` as a message header. The value of this header is the new primary key for the updated row.

* The `CREATE` event record has `__debezium.oldkey` as a message header. The value of this header is the previous (old) primary key that the updated row had.

// Type: continue
[id="mysql-delete-events"]
=== _delete_ events

The value in a _delete_ change event has the same `schema` portion as _create_ and _update_ events for the same table. The `payload` portion in a _delete_ event for the sample `customers` table looks like this:

.Descriptions of _delete_ event value fields
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`before`
|Optional field that specifies the state of the row before the event occurred. In a _delete_ event value, the `before` field contains the values that were in the row before it was deleted with the database commit.

|2
|`after`
| Optional field that specifies the state of the row after the event occurred. In a _delete_ event value, the `after` field is `null`, signifying that the row no longer exists.

|3
|`source`
a|Mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event. In a _delete_ event value, the `source` field structure is the same as for _create_ and _update_ events for the same table. Many `source` field values are also the same. In a _delete_ event value, the `ts_ms` and `pos` field values, as well as other values, might have changed. But the `source` field in a _delete_ event value provides the same metadata:

* {prodname} version
* Connector name
* binlog name where the event was recorded
* binlog position
* Row within the event
* If the event was part of a snapshot
* Name of the database and table that contain the updated row
* ID of the MySQL thread that created the event (non-snapshot only)
* MySQL server ID (if available)
* Timestamp for when the change was made in the database

If the xref:enable-query-log-events[`binlog_rows_query_log_events`] MySQL configuration option is enabled and the connector configuration `include.query` property is enabled, the `source` field also provides the `query` field, which contains the original SQL statement that caused the change event.
On MariaDB, the configuration option is `binlog_annotate_row_events`.

|4
|`op`
a|Mandatory string that describes the type of operation. The `op` field value is `d`, signifying that this row was deleted.

|5
|`ts_ms`
a|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event.
The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.  +
 +
In the `source` object, `ts_ms` indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for `payload.source.ts_ms` with the value for `payload.ts_ms`, you can determine the lag between the source database update and {prodname}.

|6
|`ts_us`
a|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event, in microseconds.
The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.

|7
|`ts_ns`
a|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event, in nanoseconds.
The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.

|===

A _delete_ change event record provides a consumer with the information it needs to process the removal of this row. The old values are included because some consumers might require them in order to properly handle the removal.

MySQL connector events are designed to work with link:{link-kafka-docs}/#compaction[Kafka log compaction]. Log compaction enables removal of some older messages as long as at least the most recent message for every key is kept. This lets Kafka reclaim storage space while ensuring that the topic contains a complete data set and can be used for reloading key-based state.

// Type: continue
[id="mysql-tombstone-events"]
=== Tombstone events
When a row is deleted, the _delete_ event value still works with log compaction, because Kafka can remove all earlier messages that have that same key. However, for Kafka to remove all messages that have that same key, the message value must be `null`. To make this possible, after {prodname}’s MySQL connector emits a _delete_ event, the connector emits a special tombstone event that has the same key but a `null` value.

// Type: continue
[id="mysql-truncate-events"]
=== _truncate_ events
A  _truncate_ change event signals that a table has been truncated.
The message key is `null` in this case, the message value looks like this:

|===

In case a single `TRUNCATE` statement applies to multiple tables,
one _truncate_ change event record for each truncated table will be emitted.

Note that since _truncate_ events represent a change made to an entire table and don't have a message key,
unless you're working with topics with a single partition,
there are no ordering guarantees for the change events pertaining to a table (_create_, _update_, etc.) and _truncate_ events for that table.
For instance a consumer may receive an _update_ event only after a _truncate_ event for that table,
when those events are read from different partitions.

// Title: How {prodname} MySQL connectors map data types
[[mysql-data-types]]
== Data type mappings

The {prodname} MySQL connector represents changes to rows with events that are structured like the table in which the row exists. The event contains a field for each column value. The MySQL data type of that column dictates how {prodname} represents the value in the event.

Columns that store strings are defined in MySQL with a character set and collation. The MySQL connector uses the column's character set when reading the binary representation of the column values in the binlog events.

The connector can map MySQL data types to both _literal_ and _semantic_ types.

* *Literal type*: how the value is represented using Kafka Connect schema types.
* *Semantic type*: how the Kafka Connect schema captures the meaning of the field (schema name).

If the default data type conversions do not meet your needs, you can {link-prefix}:{link-custom-converters}#custom-converters[create a custom converter] for the connector.

[id="mysql-temporal-types"]
=== Temporal types

Excluding the `TIMESTAMP` data type, MySQL temporal types depend on the value of the `time.precision.mode` connector configuration property. For `TIMESTAMP` columns whose default value is specified as `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` or `NOW`, the value `1970-01-01 00:00:00` is used as the default value in the Kafka Connect schema.

MySQL allows zero-values for `DATE`, `DATETIME`, and `TIMESTAMP` columns because zero-values are sometimes preferred over null values. The MySQL connector represents zero-values as null values when the column definition allows null values, or as the epoch day when the column does not allow null values.

.Temporal values without time zones
The `DATETIME` type represents a local date and time such as "2018-01-13 09:48:27". As you can see, there is no time zone information. Such columns are converted into epoch milliseconds or microseconds based on the column’s precision by using UTC. The `TIMESTAMP` type represents a timestamp without time zone information. It is converted by MySQL from the server (or session’s) current time zone into UTC when writing and from UTC into the server (or session's) current time zone when reading back the value. For example:

* `DATETIME` with a value of `2018-06-20 06:37:03` becomes `1529476623000`.
* `TIMESTAMP` with a value of `2018-06-20 06:37:03` becomes `2018-06-20T13:37:03Z`.

Such columns are converted into an equivalent `io.debezium.time.ZonedTimestamp` in UTC based on the server (or session’s) current time zone. The time zone will be queried from the server by default. If this fails, it must be specified explicitly by the database `connectionTimeZone` MySQL configuration option. For example, if the database’s time zone (either globally or configured for the connector by means of the `connectionTimeZone` option) is "America/Los_Angeles", the TIMESTAMP value "2018-06-20 06:37:03" is represented by a `ZonedTimestamp` with the value "2018-06-20T13:37:03Z".

The time zone of the JVM running Kafka Connect and Debezium does not affect these conversions.

More details about properties related to temporal values are in the documentation for xref:mysql-connector-properties[MySQL connector configuration properties].

time.precision.mode=adaptive_time_microseconds(default)::
The MySQL connector determines the literal type and semantic type based on the column's data type definition so that events represent exactly the values in the database. All time fields are in microseconds. Only positive `TIME` field values in the range of `00:00:00.000000` to `23:59:59.999999` can be captured correctly.

Set `time.precision.mode=connect` only if you can ensure that the `TIME` values in your tables never exceed the supported ranges. The `connect` setting is expected to be removed in a future version of {prodname}.

[id="mysql-boolean-values"]
=== Boolean values

MySQL handles the `BOOLEAN` value internally in a specific way.
The `BOOLEAN` column is internally mapped to the `TINYINT(1)` data type.
When the table is created during streaming then it uses proper `BOOLEAN` mapping as {prodname} receives the original DDL.
During snapshots, {prodname} executes `SHOW CREATE TABLE` to obtain table definitions that return `TINYINT(1)` for both `BOOLEAN` and `TINYINT(1)` columns. {prodname} then has no way to obtain the original type mapping and so maps to `TINYINT(1)`.

To enable you to convert source columns to Boolean data types, {prodname} provides a `TinyIntOneToBooleanConverter` {link-prefix}:{link-custom-converters}#custom-converters[custom converter] that you can use in one of the following ways:

* Map all `TINYINT(1)` or `TINYINT(1) UNSIGNED` columns to `BOOLEAN` types.
* Enumerate a subset of columns by using a comma-separated list of regular expressions. +
To use this type of conversion, you must set the xref:mysql-property-converters[`converters`] configuration property with the `selector` parameter, as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
converters=boolean
boolean.type=io.debezium.connector.mysql.converters.TinyIntOneToBooleanConverter
boolean.selector=db1.table1.*, db1.table2.column1
----
* NOTE: MySQL8 not showing the length of `tinyint unsigned` type when snapshot executes `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, which means this converter doesn't work. The new option `length.checker` can solve this issue, the default value is `true`. Disable the `length.checker` and specify the columns that need to be converted to `selector` property instead of converting all columns based on type, as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
converters=boolean
boolean.type=io.debezium.connector.mysql.converters.TinyIntOneToBooleanConverter
boolean.length.checker=false
boolean.selector=db1.table1.*, db1.table2.column1

|===

[[debezium-mysql-connector-converters]]
== Custom converters

By default, the {prodname} MySQL connector provides several `CustomConverter` implementations for MySQL data types.
These custom converters provide alternative mappings for specific data types based on the connector configuration.
To add a `CustomConverter` to the connector, follow the instructions in the link:../development/converters.adoc[Custom Converters documentation].

=== `TINYINT(1)` to Boolean

By default, during a connector snapshot, the {prodname} MySQL connector obtains column types from the JDBC driver, which assigns the `TINYINT(1)` type to `BOOLEAN` columns.
{prodname} then uses these JDBC column types to define the schema for the snapshot events.
After the connector transitions from the snapshot to the streaming phase, the change event schema that results from the default mapping can lead to inconsistent mappings for `BOOLEAN` columns.
To help ensure that MySQL emits `BOOLEAN` columns uniformly, you can apply the custom  `TinyIntOneToBooleanConverter`, as shown in the following configuration example.

.Example: `TinyIntOneToBooleanConverter` configuration
[source]
----
converters=tinyint-one-to-boolean
converters.tinyint-one-to-boolean.type=io.debezium.connector.mysql.converters.TinyIntOneToBooleanConverter
converters.tinyint-one-to-boolean.selector=.*.MY_TABLE.DATA
converters.tinyint-one-to-boolean.length.checker=false
----

In the preceding example, the `selector` and `length.checker` properties are optional.
By default, the converter checks that `TINYINT` data types conform to a length of `1`.
If `length.checker` to `false`, the converter does not explicitly confirm that the `TINYINT` data type conforms to a length of `1`.
The `selector` designates the tables or columns to convert, based on the supplied regular expression.
If you omit the `selector` property, the converter maps all `TINYINT` columns to logical `BOOL` field types.
If you do not configure a `selector` option, and you want to map `TINYINT` columns to `TINYINT(1)`, omit the `length.checker` property, or set its value to `true`.

=== JDBC sink data types

If you integrate the {prodname} JDBC sink connector with a {prodname} MySQL source connector, the MYSQL connector emits some column attributes differently during the snapshot and streaming phases.
For the JDBC sink connector to consistently consume changes from both the snapshot and streaming phase, you must include the `JdbcSinkDataTypesConverter` converter as part of the MySQL source connector configuration, as shown in the following example:

.Example: `JdbcSinkDataTypesConverter` configuration
[source]
----
converters=jdbc-sink
converters.jdbc-sink.type=io.debezium.connector.mysql.converters.JdbcSinkDataTypesConverter
converters.jdbc-sink.selector.boolean=.*.MY_TABLE.BOOL_COL
converters.jdbc-sink.selector.real=.*.MY_TABLE.REAL_COL
converters.jdbc-sink.selector.string=.*.MY_TABLE.STRING_COL
converters.jdbc-sink.treat.real.as.double=true
----

In the preceding example, the `selector.*` and `treat.real.as.double` configuration properties are optional.

The `selector.*` properties specify comma-separated lists of regular expressions that specify which tables and columns that the converter applies to.
By default, the converter applies the following rules apply to all Boolean, real, and string-based column data types, across all tables:

* `BOOLEAN` data types are always emitted as `INT16` logical types, with `1` representing `true` and `0` representing `false`
* `REAL` data types are always emitted as `FLOAT64` logical types.
* String-based columns always include the `__debezium.source.column.character_set` schema parameter that contains the column's character set.

For each data type, you can configure a selector rule to override the default scope and apply the selector to specific tables and columns only.
For example, to set the scope of the Boolean converter, add the following rule to the connector configuration, as in the preceding example: `converters.jdbc-sink.selector.boolean=.*.MY_TABLE.BOOL_COL`

[[mysql-creating-user]]
=== Creating a user

A {prodname} MySQL connector requires a MySQL user account. This MySQL user must have appropriate permissions on all databases for which the {prodname} MySQL connector captures changes.

.Prerequisites

* A MySQL server.
* Basic knowledge of SQL commands.

.Procedure

. Create the MySQL user:
+
[source,SQL]
----
mysql> CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
----

. Grant the required permissions to the user:
+
[source,SQL]
----
mysql> GRANT SELECT, RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'user' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
----
+
The table below describes the permissions.
+
IMPORTANT: If using a hosted option such as Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora that does not allow a global read lock, table-level locks are used to create the _consistent snapshot_. In this case, you need to also grant `LOCK TABLES` permissions to the user that you create. See xref:mysql-snapshots[snapshots] for more details.

. Finalize the user's permissions:
+
[source,SQL]
----
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
----

[[permissions-explained-mysql-connector]]
.Descriptions of user permissions
[cols="3,7",options="header",subs="+attributes"]
|===
|Keyword |Description

|`SELECT`
|Enables the connector to select rows from tables in databases. This is used only when performing a snapshot.

|`RELOAD`
|Enables the connector the use of the `FLUSH` statement to clear or reload internal caches, flush tables, or acquire locks. This is used only when performing a snapshot.

|`SHOW DATABASES`
|Enables the connector to see database names by issuing the `SHOW DATABASE` statement. This is used only when performing a snapshot.

|`REPLICATION SLAVE`
|Enables the connector to connect to and read the MySQL server binlog.

|`REPLICATION CLIENT`
a|Enables the connector the use of the following statements:

* `SHOW MASTER STATUS`
* `SHOW SLAVE STATUS`
* `SHOW BINARY LOGS`

The connector always requires this.

|`ON`
|Identifies the database to which the permissions apply.

|`TO 'user'`
|Specifies the user to grant the permissions to.

|`IDENTIFIED BY 'password'`
|Specifies the user's MySQL password.

// Type: procedure
// ModuleID: enabling-the-mysql-binlog-for-debezium
// Title: Enabling the MySQL binlog for {prodname}
[[enable-mysql-binlog]]
=== Enabling the binlog

You must enable binary logging for MySQL replication. The binary logs record transaction updates for replication tools to propagate changes.

.Prerequisites

* A MySQL server.
* Appropriate MySQL user privileges.

.Procedure

. Check whether the `log-bin` option is already on:
+
[source,SQL]
----
// for MySql 5.x
mysql> SELECT variable_value as "BINARY LOGGING STATUS (log-bin) ::"
FROM information_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name='log_bin';
// for MySql 8.x
mysql> SELECT variable_value as "BINARY LOGGING STATUS (log-bin) ::"
FROM performance_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name='log_bin';
----

. If it is `OFF`, configure your MySQL server configuration file with the following properties, which are described in the table below:
+
[source,properties]
----
server-id         = 223344 # Querying variable is called server_id, e.g. SELECT variable_value FROM information_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name='server_id';
log_bin                     = mysql-bin
binlog_format               = ROW
binlog_row_image            = FULL
binlog_expire_logs_seconds  = 864000
----

. Confirm your changes by checking the binlog status once more:
+

[source,SQL]
----
// for MySql 5.x
mysql> SELECT variable_value as "BINARY LOGGING STATUS (log-bin) ::"
FROM information_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name='log_bin';
// for MySql 8.x
mysql> SELECT variable_value as "BINARY LOGGING STATUS (log-bin) ::"
FROM performance_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name='log_bin';
----

. If you run MySQL on Amazon RDS, you must enable automated backups for your database instance for binary logging to occur.
If the database instance is not configured to perform automated backups, the binlog is disabled, even if you apply the settings described in the previous steps.

|Property |Description

|`server-id`
|The value for the `server-id` must be unique for each server and replication client in the MySQL cluster. During MySQL connector set up, {prodname} assigns a unique server ID to the connector.

|`log_bin`
|The value of `log_bin` is the base name of the sequence of binlog files.

|`binlog_format`
|The `binlog-format` must be set to `ROW` or `row`.

|`binlog_row_image`
|The `binlog_row_image` must be set to `FULL` or `full`.

|`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`
|The `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` corresponds to deprecated system variable `expire_logs_days`. This is the number of seconds for automatic binlog file removal. The default is `2592000`, which equals 30 days. Set the value to match the needs of your environment. See xref:mysql-purges-binlog-files-used-by-debezium[MySQL purges binlog files].

=== Deploying {prodname} MySQL connectors by building a custom Kafka Connect container image from a Dockerfile

To deploy a {prodname} MySQL connector, you must build a custom Kafka Connect container image that contains the {prodname} connector archive, and then push this container image to a container registry.
You then need to create the following custom resources (CRs):

* A `KafkaConnect` CR that defines your Kafka Connect instance.
  The `image` property in the CR specifies the name of the container image that you create to run your {prodname} connector.
  You apply this CR to the OpenShift instance where link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-amq#streams[Red Hat {StreamsName}] is deployed.
  {StreamsName} offers operators and images that bring Apache Kafka to OpenShift.

  * A `KafkaConnector` CR that defines your {prodname} MySQL connector.
    Apply this CR to the same OpenShift instance where you apply the `KafkaConnect` CR.

.Prerequisites

* MySQL is running and you completed the steps to xref:setting-up-mysql-to-run-a-debezium-connector[set up MySQL to work with a {prodname} connector].

* {StreamsName} is deployed on OpenShift and is running Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect.
For more information, see link:{LinkDeployManageStreamsOpenShift}[{NameDeployManageStreamsOpenShift}].

* Podman or Docker is installed.

* You have an account and permissions to create and manage containers in the container registry (such as `quay.io` or `docker.io`) to which you plan to add the container that will run your Debezium connector.

.Procedure

. Create the {prodname} MySQL container for Kafka Connect:

.. Create a Dockerfile that uses `{DockerKafkaConnect}` as the base image.
For example, from a terminal window, enter the following command:
+
=====================================================================

|2
|Specifies the path to your Kafka Connect plug-ins directory.
If your Kafka Connect plug-ins directory is in a different location, replace this path with the actual path of your directory.

|===
+
The command creates a Dockerfile with the name `debezium-container-for-mysql.yaml` in the current directory.

.. Build the container image from the `debezium-container-for-mysql.yaml` Docker file that you created in the previous step.
From the directory that contains the file, open a terminal window and enter one of the following commands:
+
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
podman build -t debezium-container-for-mysql:latest .
----
+
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
docker build -t debezium-container-for-mysql:latest .
----
The preceding commands build a container image with the name `debezium-container-for-mysql`.

.. Push your custom image to a container registry, such as `quay.io` or an internal container registry.
The container registry must be available to the OpenShift instance where you want to deploy the image.
Enter one of the following commands:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
podman push _<myregistry.io>_/debezium-container-for-mysql:latest
----
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
docker push _<myregistry.io>_/debezium-container-for-mysql:latest

.. Create a new {prodname} MySQL `KafkaConnect` custom resource (CR).
For example, create a `KafkaConnect` CR with the name `dbz-connect.yaml` that specifies `annotations` and `image` properties.
The following example shows an excerpt from a `dbz-connect.yaml` file that describes a `KafkaConnect` custom resource. +

|Name of the MySQL user to use when connecting to the MySQL database server.

|[[mysql-property-database-password]]<<mysql-property-database-password, `+database.password+`>>
|No default
|Password to use when connecting to the MySQL database server.

|[[mysql-property-topic-prefix]]<<mysql-property-topic-prefix, `+topic.prefix+`>>
|No default
|Topic prefix that provides a namespace for the particular MySQL database server/cluster in which {prodname} is capturing changes. The topic prefix should be unique across all other connectors, since it is used as a prefix for all Kafka topic names that receive events emitted by this connector.
Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots and underscores must be used in the database server logical name. +
 +
[WARNING]
====
Do not change the value of this property.
If you change the name value, after a restart, instead of continuing to emit events to the original topics, the connector emits subsequent events to topics whose names are based on the new value.
The connector is also unable to recover its database schema history topic.
====

|[[mysql-property-database-server-id]]<<mysql-property-database-server-id, `+database.server.id+`>>
|No default
|A numeric ID of this database client, which must be unique across all currently-running database processes in the MySQL cluster. This connector joins the MySQL database cluster as another server (with this unique ID) so it can read the binlog.

|[[mysql-property-database-include-list]]<<mysql-property-database-include-list, `+database.include.list+`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the names of the databases for which to capture changes.
The connector does not capture changes in any database whose name is not in `database.include.list`.
By default, the connector captures changes in all databases. +

To match the name of a database, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the database; it does not match substrings that might be present in a database name. +
If you include this property in the configuration, do not also set the `database.exclude.list` property.

|[[mysql-property-database-exclude-list]]<<mysql-property-database-exclude-list, `+database.exclude.list+`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the names of databases for which you do not want to capture changes.

To match the name of a database, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the database; it does not match substrings that might be present in a database name. +
If you include this property in the configuration, do not also set the `database.include.list` property.

|[[mysql-property-table-include-list]]<<mysql-property-table-include-list, `+table.include.list+`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified table identifiers of tables whose changes you want to capture.
The connector does not capture changes in any table that is not included in `table.include.list`.
Each identifier is of the form _databaseName_._tableName_.
By default, the connector captures changes in every non-system table in each database whose changes are being captured. +

To match the name of a table, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the table; it does not match substrings that might be present in a table name. +
If you include this property in the configuration, do not also set the `table.exclude.list` property.

|[[mysql-property-table-exclude-list]]<<mysql-property-table-exclude-list, `+table.exclude.list+`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified table identifiers for tables whose changes you do not want to capture.
The connector captures changes in any table that is not included in `table.exclude.list`.
Each identifier is of the form _databaseName_._tableName_. +

To match the name of a column, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the table; it does not match substrings that might be present in a table name. +
If you include this property in the configuration, do not also set the `table.include.list` property.

|[[mysql-property-column-exclude-list]]<<mysql-property-column-exclude-list, `+column.exclude.list+`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns to exclude from change event record values.
Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_. +

To match the name of a column, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.

If you include this property in the configuration, do not also set the `column.include.list` property.

|[[mysql-property-column-include-list]]<<mysql-property-column-include-list, `+column.include.list+`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns to include in change event record values.
Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_. +

To match the name of a column, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the column; it does not match substrings that might be present in a column name. +
If you include this property in the configuration, do not set the `column.exclude.list` property.

|[[mysql-property-skip-messages-without-change]]<<mysql-property-skip-messages-without-change, `+skip.messages.without.change+`>>
|`false`
| Specifies whether to skip publishing messages when there is no change in included columns. This would essentially filter messages if there is no change in columns included as per `column.include.list` or `column.exclude.list` properties.


|[[mysql-property-column-truncate-to-length-chars]]<<mysql-property-column-truncate-to-length-chars, `column.truncate.to._length_.chars`>>
|_n/a_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of character-based columns.
Set this property if you want to truncate the data in a set of columns when it exceeds the number of characters specified by the _length_ in the property name.
Set `length` to a positive integer value, for example, `column.truncate.to.20.chars`.

The fully-qualified name of a column observes the following format: _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_.
To match the name of a column, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the column; the expression does not match substrings that might be present in a column name.

You can specify multiple properties with different lengths in a single configuration.

|[[mysql-property-column-mask-with-length-chars]]<<mysql-property-column-mask-with-length-chars, `column.mask.with._length_.chars`>>
|_n/a_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of character-based columns.
Set this property if you want the connector to mask the values for a set of columns, for example, if they contain sensitive data.
Set `_length_` to a positive integer to replace data in the specified columns with the number of asterisk (`*`) characters specified by the _length_ in the property name.
Set _length_ to `0` (zero) to replace data in the specified columns with an empty string.

The fully-qualified name of a column observes the following format: _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_.
To match the name of a column, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the column; the expression does not match substrings that might be present in a column name.

You can specify multiple properties with different lengths in a single configuration.

|[[mysql-property-column-mask-hash]]<<mysql-property-column-mask-hash, `column.mask.hash._hashAlgorithm_.with.salt._salt_`>>;
[[mysql-property-column-mask-hash-v2]]<<mysql-property-column-mask-hash-v2, `column.mask.hash.v2._hashAlgorithm_.with.salt._salt_`>>
|_n/a_
a|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of character-based columns.
Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form `_<databaseName>_._<tableName>_._<columnName>_`. +
To match the name of a column {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the column; the expression does not match substrings that might be present in a column name.
In the resulting change event record, the values for the specified columns are replaced with pseudonyms. +

A pseudonym consists of the hashed value that results from applying the specified _hashAlgorithm_ and _salt_.
Based on the hash function that is used, referential integrity is maintained, while column values are replaced with pseudonyms.
Supported hash functions are described in the {link-java7-standard-names}[MessageDigest section] of the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation. +
 +
In the following example, `CzQMA0cB5K` is a randomly selected salt. +

----
column.mask.hash.SHA-256.with.salt.CzQMA0cB5K = inventory.orders.customerName, inventory.shipment.customerName
----

If necessary, the pseudonym is automatically shortened to the length of the column.
The connector configuration can include multiple properties that specify different hash algorithms and salts. +
 +
Depending on the _hashAlgorithm_ used, the _salt_ selected, and the actual data set, the resulting data set might not be completely masked. +
 +
Hashing strategy version 2 should be used to ensure fidelity if the value is being hashed in different places or systems.

|[[mysql-property-column-propagate-source-type]]<<mysql-property-column-propagate-source-type, `+column.propagate.source.type+`>>
|_n/a_
a|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns for which you want the connector to emit extra parameters that represent column metadata.
When this property is set, the connector adds the following fields to the schema of event records:

* `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.type` +
* `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.length` +
* `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.scale` +

These parameters propagate a column's original type name and length (for variable-width types), respectively. +
Enabling the connector to emit this extra data can assist in properly sizing specific numeric or character-based columns in sink databases.

The fully-qualified name of a column observes one of the following formats: _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_, or _databaseName_._schemaName_._tableName_._columnName_. +
To match the name of a column, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the column; the expression does not match substrings that might be present in a column name.

|[[mysql-property-datatype-propagate-source-type]]<<mysql-property-datatype-propagate-source-type, `+datatype.propagate.source.type+`>>
|_n/a_
a|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that specify the fully-qualified names of data types that are defined for columns in a database.
When this property is set, for columns with matching data types, the connector emits event records that include the following extra fields in their schema:

* `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.type` +
* `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.length` +
* `pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.scale` +

These parameters propagate a column's original type name and length (for variable-width types), respectively. +
Enabling the connector to emit this extra data can assist in properly sizing specific numeric or character-based columns in sink databases.

The fully-qualified name of a column observes one of the following formats: _databaseName_._tableName_._typeName_, or _databaseName_._schemaName_._tableName_._typeName_. +
To match the name of a data type, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the data type; the expression does not match substrings that might be present in a type name.

For the list of MySQL-specific data type names, see the xref:mysql-data-types[MySQL data type mappings].

|[[mysql-property-time-precision-mode]]<<mysql-property-time-precision-mode, `+time.precision.mode+`>>
|`adaptive_time_microseconds`
|Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precision, including: +
 +
`adaptive_time_microseconds` (the default) captures the date, datetime and timestamp values exactly as in the database using either millisecond, microsecond, or nanosecond precision values based on the database column's type, with the exception of TIME type fields, which are always captured as microseconds. +
 +
ifdef::community[]
`adaptive` (deprecated) captures the time and timestamp values exactly as in the database using either millisecond, microsecond, or nanosecond precision values based on the database column's type. +
endif::community[]
 +
`connect` always represents time and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which use millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision.

|[[mysql-property-decimal-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-decimal-handling-mode,`+decimal.handling.mode+`>>
|`precise`
|Specifies how the connector should handle values for `DECIMAL` and `NUMERIC` columns: +
 +
`precise` (the default) represents them precisely using `java.math.BigDecimal` values represented in change events in a binary form. +
 +
`double` represents them using `double` values, which may result in a loss of precision but is easier to use. +
 +
`string` encodes values as formatted strings, which is easy to consume but  semantic information about the real type is lost.

|[[mysql-property-bigint-unsigned-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-bigint-unsigned-handling-mode, `+bigint.unsigned.handling.mode+`>>
|`long`
|Specifies how BIGINT UNSIGNED columns should be represented in change events. Possible settings are: +
 +
 `long` represents values by using Java's `long`, which might not offer the precision but which is easy to use in consumers. `long` is usually the preferred setting. +
 +
`precise` uses `java.math.BigDecimal` to represent values, which are encoded in the change events by using a binary representation and Kafka Connect's `org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal` type. Use this setting when working with values larger than 2^63, because these values cannot be conveyed by using `long`.

|[[mysql-property-include-schema-changes]]<<mysql-property-include-schema-changes, `+include.schema.changes+`>>
|`true`
|Boolean value that specifies whether the connector should publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic with the same name as the database server ID. Each schema change is recorded by using a key that contains the database name and whose value includes the DDL statement(s). This is independent of how the connector internally records database schema history.

|[[mysql-property-include-schema-comments]]<<mysql-property-include-schema-comments, `+include.schema.comments+`>>
|`false`
|Boolean value that specifies whether the connector should parse and publish table and column comments on metadata objects. Enabling this option will bring the implications on memory usage. The number and size of logical schema objects is what largely impacts how much memory is consumed by the Debezium connectors, and adding potentially large string data to each of them can potentially be quite expensive.

|[[mysql-property-include-query]]<<mysql-property-include-query, `+include.query+`>>
|`false`
|Boolean value that specifies whether the connector should include the original SQL query that generated the change event. +
 +
If you set this option to `true` then you must also configure MySQL with the `binlog_rows_query_log_events` option or MariaDB with the `binlog_annotate_row_events` option set to `ON`.
When `include.query` is `true`, the query is not present for events that the snapshot process generates.
 +
Setting `include.query` to `true` might expose tables or fields that are explicitly excluded or masked by including the original SQL statement in the change event.
For this reason, the default setting is `false`.

For more information about configuring the database to return the original `SQL` statement for each log event, see xref:enable-query-log-events[Enabling query log events].

|[[mysql-property-event-deserialization-failure-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-event-deserialization-failure-handling-mode, `+event.deserialization.failure.handling.mode+`>>
|`fail`
|Specifies how the connector should react to exceptions during deserialization of binlog events.
This option is deprecated, please use xref:mysql-property-event-processing-failure-handling-mode[`event.processing.failure.handling.mode`] option instead. +
 +
`fail` propagates the exception, which indicates the problematic event and its binlog offset, and causes the connector to stop. +
 +
`warn` logs the problematic event and its binlog offset and then skips the event. +
 +
`ignore` passes over the problematic event and does not log anything.

|[[mysql-property-inconsistent-schema-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-inconsistent-schema-handling-mode, `+inconsistent.schema.handling.mode+`>>
|`fail`
|Specifies how the connector should react to binlog events that relate to tables that are not present in internal schema representation. That is, the internal representation is not consistent with the database. +
 +
`fail` throws an exception that indicates the problematic event and its binlog offset, and causes the connector to stop. +
 +
`warn` logs the problematic event and its binlog offset and skips the event. +
 +
`skip` passes over the problematic event and does not log anything.

|[[mysql-property-connect-timeout-ms]]<<mysql-property-connect-timeout-ms, `+connect.timeout.ms+`>>
|`30000`
|A positive integer value that specifies the maximum time in milliseconds this connector should wait after trying to connect to the MySQL database server before timing out. Defaults to 30 seconds.

|[[mysql-property-gtid-source-includes]]<<mysql-property-gtid-source-includes, `+gtid.source.includes+`>>
|No default
|A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match source UUIDs in the GTID set used that the connector uses to find the binlog position on the MySQL server.
When this property is set, the connector uses only the GTID ranges that have source UUIDs that match one of the specified `include` patterns.

To match the value of a GTID, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire UUID string; it does not match substrings that might be present in the UUID. +
If you include this property in the configuration, do not also set the `gtid.source.excludes` property.

|[[mysql-property-gtid-source-excludes]]<<mysql-property-gtid-source-excludes, `+gtid.source.excludes+`>>
|No default
|A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match source UUIDs in the GTID set that the connector uses to find the binlog position on the MySQL server.
When this property is set, the connector uses only the GTID ranges that have source UUIDs that do not match any of the specified `exclude` patterns.

To match the value of a GTID, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire UUID string; it does not match substrings that might be present in the UUID. +
If you include this property in the configuration, do not also set the `gtid.source.includes` property.

|[[mysql-property-tombstones-on-delete]]<<mysql-property-tombstones-on-delete, `+tombstones.on.delete+`>>
|`true`
|Controls whether a _delete_ event is followed by a tombstone event. +
 +
`true` - a delete operation is represented by a _delete_ event and a subsequent tombstone event.  +
 +
`false` - only a _delete_ event is emitted. +
 +
After a source record is deleted, emitting a tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events that pertain to the key of the deleted row in case {link-kafka-docs}/#compaction[log compaction] is enabled for the topic.

|[[mysql-property-message-key-columns]]<<mysql-property-message-key-columns, `+message.key.columns+`>>
|_n/a_
|A list of expressions that specify the columns that the connector uses to form custom message keys for change event records that it publishes to the Kafka topics for specified tables.

By default, {prodname} uses the primary key column of a table as the message key for records that it emits.
In place of the default, or to specify a key for tables that lack a primary key, you can configure custom message keys based on one or more columns. +
 +
To establish a custom message key for a table, list the table, followed by the columns to use as the message key.
Each list entry takes the following format: +
 +
`_<fully-qualified_tableName>_:__<keyColumn>__,_<keyColumn>_` +
 +
To base a table key on multiple column names, insert commas between the column names.

Each fully-qualified table name is a regular expression in the following format: +
 +
`_<databaseName>_._<tableName>_` +
 +
The property can include entries for multiple tables.
Use a semicolon to separate table entries in the list. +
 +
The following example sets the message key for the tables `inventory.customers` and `purchase.orders`: +
 +
`inventory.customers:pk1,pk2;(.*).purchaseorders:pk3,pk4` +
 +
For the table `inventory.customer`, the columns `pk1` and `pk2` are specified as the message key.
For the `purchaseorders` tables in any database, the columns `pk3` and `pk4` server as the message key.

There is no limit to the number of columns that you use to create custom message keys.
However, it's best to use the minimum number that are required to specify a unique key.
|[[mysql-property-binary-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-binary-handling-mode,`+binary.handling.mode+`>>
|bytes
|Specifies how binary columns, for example, `blob`, `binary`, `varbinary`, should be represented in change events. Possible settings:  +
 +
`bytes` represents binary data as a byte array. +
 +
`base64` represents binary data as a base64-encoded String. +
 +
`base64-url-safe` represents binary data as a base64-url-safe-encoded String. +
 +
`hex` represents binary data as a hex-encoded (base16) String.

|[[mysql-property-schema-name-adjustment-mode]]<<mysql-property-schema-name-adjustment-mode,`+schema.name.adjustment.mode+`>>
|none
|Specifies how schema names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector. Possible settings:  +

* `none` does not apply any adjustment. +
* `avro` replaces the characters that cannot be used in the Avro type name with underscore. +
* `avro_unicode` replaces the underscore or characters that cannot be used in the Avro type name with corresponding unicode like _uxxxx. Note: _ is an escape sequence like backslash in Java +

|[[mysql-property-field-name-adjustment-mode]]<<mysql-property-field-name-adjustment-mode,`+field.name.adjustment.mode+`>>
|none
|Specifies how field names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector. Possible settings:  +

* `none` does not apply any adjustment. +
* `avro` replaces the characters that cannot be used in the Avro type name with underscore. +
* `avro_unicode` replaces the underscore or characters that cannot be used in the Avro type name with corresponding unicode like _uxxxx. Note: _ is an escape sequence like backslash in Java +

[cols="30%a,20%a,50%a",options="header",subs="+attributes"]
|===
|Property |Default |Description

|[[mysql-property-connect-keep-alive]]<<mysql-property-connect-keep-alive, `+connect.keep.alive+`>>
|`true`
|A Boolean value that specifies whether a separate thread should be used to ensure that the connection to the MySQL server/cluster is kept alive.

|[[mysql-property-converters]]<<mysql-property-converters, `converters`>>
|No default
|Enumerates a comma-separated list of the symbolic names of the {link-prefix}:{link-custom-converters}#custom-converters[custom converter] instances that the connector can use. +
For example, `boolean`. +
This property is required to enable the connector to use a custom converter.

For each converter that you configure for a connector, you must also add a `.type` property, which specifies the fully-qualified name of the class that implements the converter interface.
The `.type` property uses the following format: +

For example, +

 boolean.type: io.debezium.connector.mysql.converters.TinyIntOneToBooleanConverter

If you want to further control the behavior of a configured converter, you can add one or more configuration parameters to pass values to the converter.
To associate these additional configuration parameter with a converter, prefix the paraemeter name with the symbolic name of the converter. +
 +
For example, to define a `selector` parameter that specifies the subset of columns that the `boolean` converter processes, add the following property: +

 boolean.selector=db1.table1.*, db1.table2.column1

|[[mysql-property-table-ignore-builtin]]<<mysql-property-table-ignore-builtin, `+table.ignore.builtin+`>>
|`true`
|A Boolean value that specifies whether built-in system tables should be ignored. This applies regardless of the table include and exclude lists. By default, system tables are excluded from having their changes captured, and no events are generated when changes are made to any system tables.

|[[mysql-property-database-ssl-mode]]<<mysql-property-database-ssl-mode, `+database.ssl.mode+`>>
|`preferred`
|Specifies whether to use an encrypted connection. Possible settings are: +
 +
`disabled` specifies the use of an unencrypted connection. +
 +
`preferred` establishes an encrypted connection if the server supports secure connections. If the server does not support secure connections, falls back to an unencrypted connection. +
 +
`required` establishes an encrypted connection or fails if one cannot be made for any reason. +
 +
`verify_ca` behaves like `required` but additionally it verifies the server TLS certificate against the configured Certificate Authority (CA) certificates and fails if the server TLS certificate does not match any valid CA certificates. +
 +
`verify_identity` behaves like `verify_ca` but additionally verifies that the server certificate matches the host of the remote connection.
|[[mysql-property-database-ssl-keystore]]<<mysql-property-database-ssl-keystore, `+database.ssl.keystore+`>>

|[[mysql-property-database-ssl-keystore-password]]<<mysql-property-database-ssl-keystore-password, `+database.ssl.keystore.password+`>>
|No defaults
|The password for the key store file.
 This is optional and only needed if xref:mysql-property-database-ssl-keystore[`database.ssl.keystore`] is configured.
|[[mysql-property-database-ssl-truststore]]<<mysql-property-database-ssl-truststore, `+database.ssl.truststore+`>>

|[[mysql-property-binlog-buffer-size]]<<mysql-property-binlog-buffer-size, `+binlog.buffer.size+`>>
|0
|The size of a look-ahead buffer used by the binlog reader. The default setting of `0` disables buffering. +
 +
Under specific conditions, it is possible that the MySQL binlog contains uncommitted data finished by a `ROLLBACK` statement.
Typical examples are using savepoints or mixing temporary and regular table changes in a single transaction. +
 +
When a beginning of a transaction is detected then {prodname} tries to roll forward the binlog position and find either `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` so it can determine whether to stream the changes from the transaction.
The size of the binlog buffer defines the maximum number of changes in the transaction that {prodname} can buffer while searching for transaction boundaries.
If the size of the transaction is larger than the buffer then {prodname} must rewind and re-read the events that have not fit into the buffer while streaming. +
 +
NOTE: This feature is incubating. Feedback is encouraged. It is expected that this feature is not completely polished.

|[[mysql-property-max-queue-size]]<<mysql-property-max-queue-size, `+max.queue.size+`>>
|`8192`
|Positive integer value that specifies the maximum number of records that the blocking queue can hold.
When {prodname} reads events streamed from the database, it places the events in the blocking queue before it writes them to Kafka.
The blocking queue can provide backpressure for reading change events from the database
in cases where the connector ingests messages faster than it can write them to Kafka, or when Kafka becomes unavailable.
Events that are held in the queue are disregarded when the connector periodically records offsets.
Always set the value of `max.queue.size` to be larger than the value of xref:{context}-property-max-batch-size[`max.batch.size`].

|[[mysql-property-max-queue-size-in-bytes]]<<mysql-property-max-queue-size-in-bytes, `+max.queue.size.in.bytes+`>>
|`0`
|A long integer value that specifies the maximum volume of the blocking queue in bytes.
By default, volume limits are not specified for the blocking queue.
To specify the number of bytes that the queue can consume, set this property to a positive long value. +
If xref:mysql-property-max-queue-size[`max.queue.size`] is also set, writing to the queue is blocked when the size of the queue reaches the limit specified by either property.
For example, if you set `max.queue.size=1000`, and `max.queue.size.in.bytes=5000`, writing to the queue is blocked after the queue contains 1000 records, or after the volume of the records in the queue reaches 5000 bytes.

|[[mysql-property-poll-interval-ms]]<<mysql-property-poll-interval-ms, `+poll.interval.ms+`>>
|`500`
|Positive integer value that specifies the number of milliseconds the connector should wait for new change events to appear before it starts processing a batch of events. Defaults to 500 milliseconds, or 0.5 second.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-mode]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-mode, `+snapshot.mode+`>>
|_initial_
|Specifies the criteria for running a snapshot when the connector starts. Possible settings are: +

`always`:: The connector performs a snapshot every time that it starts.
The snapshot includes the structure and data of the captured tables.
Specify this value to populate topics with a complete representation of the data from the captured tables every time that the connector starts.

`initial`:: The connector runs a snapshot only when no offsets have been recorded for the logical server name, or if it detects that an earlier snapshot failed to complete.
After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream event records for subsequent database changes.

`initial_only`:: The connector runs a snapshot only when no offsets have been recorded for the logical server name.
After the snapshot completes, the connector stops.
It does not transition to streaming to read change events from the binlog.

`schema_only`:: Deprecated, see `no_data`.

`no_data`:: The connector runs a snapshot that captures only the schema, but not any table data.
Set this option if you do not need the topics to contain a consistent snapshot of the data, but you want to capture any schema changes that were applied after the last connector restart.

`schema_only_recovery`:: Deprecated, see `recovery`.

`recovery`::  Set this option to restore a database schema history topic that is lost or corrupted.
After a restart, the connector runs a snapshot that rebuilds the topic from the source tables.
You can also set the property to periodically prune a database schema history topic that experiences unexpected growth. +
 +
WARNING: Do not use this mode to perform a snapshot if schema changes were committed to the database after the last connector shutdown.

`never`:: When the connector starts, rather than performing a snapshot, it immediately begins to stream event records for subsequent database changes.
This option is under consideration for future deprecation, in favor of the `no_data` option.

`when_needed`:: After the connector starts, it performs a snapshot only if it detects one of the following circumstances:

* It cannot detect any topic offsets.
* A previously recorded offset specifies a binlog position or GTID that is not available on the server.

|_minimal_
a|Controls whether and how long the connector holds the global MySQL read lock, which prevents any updates to the database, while the connector is performing a snapshot. Possible settings are: +

`minimal`:: The connector holds the global read lock for only the initial phase of the snapshot during which it reads the database schemas and other metadata.
During the next phase of the snapshot, the connector releases the lock as it selects all rows from each table.
To perform the SELECT operation in a consistent fashion, the connector uses a REPEATABLE READ transaction.
Although the release of the global read lock permits other MySQL clients to update the database, use of REPEATABLE READ isolation ensures a consistent snapshot, because the connector continues to read the same data for the duration of  the transaction. +

`minimal_percona`:: The connector holds link:https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/management/backup_locks.html[the global backup lock] for only the initial phase of the snapshot during which it reads the database schemas and other metadata.
During the next phase of the snapshot, the connector releases the lock as it selects all rows from each table.
To perform the SELECT operation in a consistent fashion, the connector uses a REPEATABLE READ transaction.

Although the release of the global read lock permits other MySQL clients to update the database, use of REPEATABLE READ isolation ensures a consistent snapshot, because the connector continues to read the same data for the duration of  the transaction. +
This mode does not flush tables to disk, is not blocked by long-running reads, and is available only in Percona Server. +

`extended`:: Blocks all write operations for the duration of the snapshot.
Use this setting if clients submit concurrent operations that are incompatible with the REPEATABLE READ isolation level in MySQL. +

`none`:: Prevents the connector from acquiring any table locks during the snapshot.
Although this option is allowed with all snapshot modes, it is safe to use _only_ if no schema changes occur while the snapshot is running.
Tables that are defined with the MyISAM engine always acquire a table lock.
As a result, such tables are locked even if you set this option.
This behavior differs from tables that are defined by the InnoDB engine, which acquire row-level locks.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-include-collection-list]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-include-collection-list, `+snapshot.include.collection.list+`>>
| All tables specified in `table.include.list`
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names (`_<databaseName>.<tableName>_`) of the tables to include in a snapshot.
The specified items must be named in the connector's xref:mysql-property-table-include-list[`table.include.list`] property.
This property takes effect only if the connector's xref:mysql-property-snapshot-mode[`snapshot.mode`] property is set to a value other than `never`. +
This property does not affect the behavior of incremental snapshots. +

To match the name of a table, {prodname} applies the regular expression that you specify as an _anchored_ regular expression.
That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the table; it does not match substrings that might be present in a table name.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-select-statement-overrides]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-select-statement-overrides, `+snapshot.select.statement.overrides+`>>
|No default
|Specifies the table rows to include in a snapshot.
Use the property if you want a snapshot to include only a subset of the rows in a table.
This property affects snapshots only.
It does not apply to events that the connector reads from the log.

The property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified table names in the form `_<databaseName>.<tableName>_`. For example, +
 +
`+"snapshot.select.statement.overrides": "inventory.products,customers.orders"+` +
 +
For each table in the list, add a further configuration property that specifies the `SELECT` statement for the connector to run on the table when it takes a snapshot.
The specified `SELECT` statement determines the subset of table rows to include in the snapshot.
Use the following format to specify the name of this `SELECT` statement property: +
 +
`snapshot.select.statement.overrides._<databaseName>_._<tableName>_`.
For example,
`snapshot.select.statement.overrides.customers.orders`. +
 +
Example:

From a `customers.orders` table that includes the soft-delete column, `delete_flag`, add the following properties if you want a snapshot to include only those records that are not soft-deleted:

----
"snapshot.select.statement.overrides": "customer.orders",
"snapshot.select.statement.overrides.customer.orders": "SELECT * FROM [customers].[orders] WHERE delete_flag = 0 ORDER BY id DESC"
----

In the resulting snapshot, the connector includes only the records for which `delete_flag = 0`.
|[[mysql-property-min-row-count-to-stream-results]]<<mysql-property-min-row-count-to-stream-results, `+min.row.count.to.stream.results+`>>
|`1000`
|During a snapshot, the connector queries each table for which the connector is configured to capture changes. The connector uses each query result to produce a read event that contains data for all rows in that table. This property determines whether the MySQL connector puts results for a table into memory, which is fast but requires large amounts of memory, or streams the results, which can be slower but work for very large tables. The setting of this property specifies the minimum number of rows a table must contain before the connector streams results. +
 +
To skip all table size checks and always stream all results during a snapshot, set this property to `0`.

|[[mysql-property-heartbeat-interval-ms]]<<mysql-property-heartbeat-interval-ms, `+heartbeat.interval.ms+`>>
|`0`
|Controls how frequently the connector sends heartbeat messages to a Kafka topic. The default behavior is that the connector does not send heartbeat messages. +
 +
Heartbeat messages are useful for monitoring whether the connector is receiving change events from the database. Heartbeat messages might help decrease the number of change events that need to be re-sent when a connector restarts. To send heartbeat messages, set this property to a positive integer, which indicates the number of milliseconds between heartbeat messages.

|[[mysql-property-heartbeat-action-query]]<<mysql-property-heartbeat-action-query, `+heartbeat.action.query+`>>
|No default
|Specifies a query that the connector executes on the source database when the connector sends a heartbeat message. +
 +
For example, this can be used to periodically capture the state of the executed GTID set in the source database. +
 +
`INSERT INTO gtid_history_table (select * from mysql.gtid_executed)`

|[[mysql-property-database-initial-statements]]<<mysql-property-database-initial-statements, `+database.initial.statements+`>>
|No default
|A semicolon separated list of SQL statements to be executed when a JDBC connection, not the connection that is reading the transaction log, to the database is established.
To specify a semicolon as a character in a SQL statement and not as a delimiter, use two semicolons, (`;;`). +
 +
The connector might establish JDBC connections at its own discretion, so this property is ony for configuring session parameters. It is not for executing DML statements.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-delay-ms]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-delay-ms, `+snapshot.delay.ms+`>>
|No default
|An interval in milliseconds that the connector should wait before performing a snapshot when the connector starts. If you are starting multiple connectors in a cluster, this property is useful for avoiding snapshot interruptions, which might cause re-balancing of connectors.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-fetch-size]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-fetch-size, `+snapshot.fetch.size+`>>
|No default
|During a snapshot, the connector reads table content in batches of rows. This property specifies the maximum number of rows in a batch.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-lock-timeout-ms]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-lock-timeout-ms, `+snapshot.lock.timeout.ms+`>>
|`10000`
|Positive integer that specifies the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait to obtain table locks when performing a snapshot. If the connector cannot acquire table locks in this time interval, the snapshot fails. See xref:mysql-snapshots[how MySQL connectors perform database snapshots].

|[[mysql-property-enable-time-adjuster]]<<mysql-property-enable-time-adjuster, `+enable.time.adjuster+`>>
|`true`
|Boolean value that indicates whether the connector converts a 2-digit year specification to 4 digits. Set to `false` when conversion is fully delegated to the database. +
 +
MySQL allows users to insert year values with either 2-digits or 4-digits. For 2-digit values, the value gets mapped to a year in the range 1970 - 2069. The default behavior is that the connector does the conversion.

ifdef::community[]
|[[mysql-property-source-struct-version]]<<mysql-property-source-struct-version, `+source.struct.version+`>>
|`v2`
|Schema version for the `source` block in {prodname} events.  {prodname} 0.10 introduced a few breaking changes to the structure of the `source` block in order to unify the exposed structure across all the connectors. +

By setting this option to `v1`, the structure used in earlier versions can be produced. However, this setting is not recommended and is planned for removal in a future {prodname} version.
endif::community[]

|[[mysql-property-skipped-operations]]<<mysql-property-skipped-operations, `+skipped.operations+`>>
|`t`
|A comma-separated list of operation types that will be skipped during streaming.
The operations include: `c` for inserts/create, `u` for updates, `d` for deletes, `t` for truncates, and `none` to not skip any operations.
By default, truncate operations are skipped.

|[[mysql-property-incremental-snapshot-allow-schema-changes]]<<mysql-property-incremental-snapshot-allow-schema-changes, `+incremental.snapshot.allow.schema.changes+`>>
|`false`
| Allow schema changes during an incremental snapshot. When enabled the connector will detect schema change during an incremental snapshot and re-select a current chunk to avoid locking DDLs. +
 +
Note that changes to a primary key are not supported and can cause incorrect results if performed during an incremental snapshot. Another limitation is that if a schema change affects only columns' default values, then the change won't be detected until the DDL is processed from the binlog stream. This doesn't affect the snapshot events' values, but the schema of snapshot events may have outdated defaults.

|[[mysql-property-incremental-snapshot-chunk-size]]<<mysql-property-incremental-snapshot-chunk-size, `+incremental.snapshot.chunk.size+`>>
|`1024`
|The maximum number of rows that the connector fetches and reads into memory during an incremental snapshot chunk.
Increasing the chunk size provides greater efficiency, because the snapshot runs fewer snapshot queries of a greater size.
However, larger chunk sizes also require more memory to buffer the snapshot data.
Adjust the chunk size to a value that provides the best performance in your environment.

|[[mysql-property-incremental-snapshot-watermarking-strategy]]<<mysql-property-incremental-snapshot-watermarking-strategy, `+incremental.snapshot.watermarking.strategy+`>>
|`insert_insert`
|Specifies the watermarking mechanism that the connector uses during an incremental snapshot to deduplicate events that might be captured by an incremental snapshot and then recaptured after streaming resumes. +
You can specify one of the following options:

`insert_insert`:: When you send a signal to initiate an incremental snapshot, for every chunk that {prodname} reads during the snapshot, it writes an entry to the signaling data collection to record the signal to open the snapshot window.
After the snapshot completes, {prodname} inserts a second entry that records the signal to close the window.
`insert_delete`:: When you send a signal to initiate an incremental snapshot, for every chunk that {prodname} reads, it writes a single entry to the signaling data collection to record the signal to open the snapshot window.
After the snapshot completes, this entry is removed.
No entry is created for the signal to close the snapshot window.
Set this option to prevent rapid growth of the signaling data collection.

|[[mysql-property-event-processing-failure-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-event-processing-failure-handling-mode, `event.processing.failure.handling.mode`>>
|`fail`
|Specify how failures during processing of events (i.e. when encountering a corrupted event) should be handled. By default, `fail` mode raises an exception indicating the problematic event and its position, causing the connector to be stopped. `warn` mode does not raise the exception, instead the problematic event and its position will be logged and the event will be skipped. `ignore` mode ignores the problematic event completely with no logging.

|[[mysql-property-topic-naming-strategy]]<<mysql-property-topic-naming-strategy, `topic.naming.strategy`>>
|`io.debezium.schema.DefaultTopicNamingStrategy`
|The name of the TopicNamingStrategy class that should be used to determine the topic name for data change, schema change, transaction, heartbeat event etc., defaults to `DefaultTopicNamingStrategy`.

|Controls the order in which the connector processes tables when it performs an initial snapshot.
Specify one of the following options:

`descending`:: The connector snapshots tables in order, based on the number of rows from the highest to the lowest.
`ascending`:: The connector snapshots tables in order, based on the number of rows, from lowest to highest.
`disabled`:: The connector disregards row count when performing an initial snapshot.

== Monitoring

The {prodname} MySQL connector provides three types of metrics that are in addition to the built-in support for JMX metrics that Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect provide.

* xref:mysql-snapshot-metrics[Snapshot metrics] provide information about connector operation while performing a snapshot.
* xref:mysql-streaming-metrics[Streaming metrics] provide information about connector operation when the connector is reading the binlog.
* xref:mysql-schema-history-metrics[Schema history metrics] provide information about the status of the connector's schema history.

{link-prefix}:{link-debezium-monitoring}#monitoring-debezium[{prodname} monitoring documentation] provides details for how to expose these metrics by using JMX.

include::{partialsdir}/modules/all-connectors/ref-connector-monitoring-incremental-snapshot-metrics.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The {prodname} MySQL connector also provides the `HoldingGlobalLock` custom snapshot metric. This metric is set to a Boolean value that indicates whether the connector currently holds a global or table write lock.

.Descriptions of additional streaming metrics
[cols="3,2,5",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Description

|[[binlog-filename]]<<binlog-filename,`+BinlogFilename+`>>
|`string`
|The name of the binlog file that the connector has most recently read.

|[[binlog-position]]<<binlog-position,`+BinlogPosition+`>>
|`long`
|The most recent position (in bytes) within the binlog that the connector has read.

|[[is-gtid-mode-enabled]]<<is-gtid-mode-enabled,`+IsGtidModeEnabled+`>>
|`boolean`
|Flag that denotes whether the connector is currently tracking GTIDs from MySQL server.

|[[gtid-set]]<<gtid-set,`+GtidSet+`>>
|`string`
|The string representation of the most recent GTID set processed by the connector when reading the binlog.

|[[number-of-skipped-events]]<<number-of-skipped-events,`+NumberOfSkippedEvents+`>>
|`long`
|The number of events that have been skipped by the MySQL connector. Typically events are skipped due to a malformed or unparseable event from MySQL's binlog.

|[[number-of-disconnects]]<<number-of-disconnects,`+NumberOfDisconnects+`>>
|`long`
|The number of disconnects by the MySQL connector.

|[[number-of-rolled-back-transactions]]<<number-of-rolled-back-transactions,`+NumberOfRolledBackTransactions+`>>
|`long`
|The number of processed transactions that were rolled back and not streamed.

|[[number-of-not-well-formed-transactions]]<<number-of-not-well-formed-transactions,`+NumberOfNotWellFormedTransactions+`>>
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not conformed to the expected protocol of `BEGIN` + `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`. This value should be `0` under normal conditions.

|[[number-of-large-transactions]]<<number-of-large-transactions,`+NumberOfLargeTransactions+`>>
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not fit into the look-ahead buffer. For optimal performance, this value should be significantly smaller than `NumberOfCommittedTransactions` and `NumberOfRolledBackTransactions`.

[[mysql-when-things-go-wrong]]
== Behavior when things go wrong

{prodname} is a distributed system that captures all changes in multiple upstream databases; it never misses or loses an event. When the system is operating normally or being managed carefully then {prodname} provides _exactly once_ delivery of every change event record.

If a fault does happen then the system does not lose any events. However, while it is recovering from the fault, it might repeat some change events. In these abnormal situations, {prodname}, like Kafka, provides _at least once_ delivery of change events.

ifdef::community[]
The rest of this section describes how {prodname} handles various kinds of faults and problems.

[id="debezium-mysql-connector-configuration-and-startup-errors"]
=== Configuration and startup errors

In the following situations, the connector fails when trying to start, reports an error or exception in the log, and stops running:

* The connector's configuration is invalid.
* The connector cannot successfully connect to the MySQL server by using the specified connection parameters.
* The connector is attempting to restart at a position in the binlog for which MySQL no longer has the history available.

In these cases, the error message has details about the problem and possibly a suggested workaround. After you correct the configuration or address the MySQL problem, restart the connector.

[id="mysql-becomes-unavailable-while-debezium-is-running"]
=== MySQL becomes unavailable

If your MySQL server becomes unavailable, the {prodname} MySQL connector fails with an error and the connector stops. When the server is available again, restart the connector.

However, if GTIDs are enabled for a highly available MySQL cluster, you can restart the connector immediately. It will connect to a different MySQL server in the cluster, find the location in the server's binlog that represents the last transaction, and begin reading the new server's binlog from that specific location.

If GTIDs are not enabled, the connector records the binlog position of only the MySQL server to which it was connected. To restart from the correct binlog position, you must reconnect to that specific server.

[id="debezium-mysql-kafka-connect-process-stops-gracefully"]
=== Kafka Connect stops gracefully

When Kafka Connect stops gracefully, there is a short delay while the {prodname} MySQL connector tasks are stopped and restarted on new Kafka Connect processes.

[id="debezium-mysql-kafka-connect-process-crashes"]
=== Kafka Connect process crashes

If Kafka Connect crashes, the process stops and any {prodname} MySQL connector tasks terminate without their most recently-processed offsets being recorded. In distributed mode, Kafka Connect restarts the connector tasks on other processes. However, the MySQL connector resumes from the last offset recorded by the earlier processes. This means that the replacement tasks might generate some of the same events processed prior to the crash, creating duplicate events.

Each change event message includes source-specific information that you can use to identify duplicate events, for example:

* Event origin
* MySQL server's event time
* The binlog file name and position
* GTIDs (if used)

[id="debezium-mysql-kafka-process-becomes-unavailable"]
=== Kafka becomes unavailable

The Kafka Connect framework records {prodname} change events in Kafka by using the Kafka producer API. If the Kafka brokers become unavailable, the {prodname} MySQL connector pauses until the connection is reestablished and the connector resumes where it left off.

[id="mysql-purges-binlog-files-used-by-debezium"]
=== MySQL purges binlog files

If the {prodname} MySQL connector stops for too long, the MySQL server purges older binlog files and the connector's last position may be lost. When the connector is restarted, the MySQL server no longer has the starting point and the connector performs another initial snapshot. If the snapshot is disabled, the connector fails with an error.

See xref:mysql-snapshots[snapshots] for details about how MySQL connectors perform initial snapshots.
