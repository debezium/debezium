MySQL has a binary log (binlog) that records all operations in the order in which they are committed to the database. This includes changes to table schemas as well as changes to the data in tables. MySQL uses the binlog for replication and recovery.

The {prodname} MySQL connector reads the binlog, produces change events for row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations, and emits the change events to Kafka topics. Client applications read those Kafka topics.

As MySQL is typically set up to purge binlogs after a specified period of time, the MySQL connector performs an initial _consistent snapshot_ of each of your databases. The MySQL connector reads the binlog from the point at which the snapshot was made.

== How the connector works

An overview of the MySQL topologies that the connector supports is useful for planning your application. To optimally configure and run a {prodname} MySQL connector, it is helpful to understand how the connector tracks the structure of tables, exposes schema changes, performs snapshots, and determines Kafka topic names.

// Title: MySQL topologies supported by {prodname} connectors
[id="supported-mysql-topologies"]
=== Supported MySQL topologies

The {prodname} MySQL connector supports the following MySQL topologies:

Standalone::
When a single MySQL server is used, the server must have the binlog enabled (_and optionally GTIDs enabled_) so the {prodname} MySQL connector can monitor the server. This is often acceptable, since the binary log can also be used as an incremental link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/backup-methods.html[backup]. In this case, the MySQL connector always connects to and follows this standalone MySQL server instance.

Primary and replica::
The {prodname} MySQL connector can follow one of the primary servers or one of the replicas (_if that replica has its binlog enabled_), but the connector sees changes in only the cluster that is visible to that server. Generally, this is not a problem except for the multi-primary topologies.
+
The connector records its position in the server’s binlog, which is different on each server in the cluster. Therefore, the connector must follow just one MySQL server instance. If that server fails, that server must be restarted or recovered before the connector can continue.

High available clusters::
A variety of link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-ha-scalability/en/[high availability] solutions exist for MySQL, and they make it significantly easier to tolerate and almost immediately recover from problems and failures. Most HA MySQL clusters use GTIDs so that replicas are able to keep track of all changes on any of the primary servers.

Multi-primary::
link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/mysql-cluster-replication-multi-source.html[Network Database (NDB) cluster replication] uses one or more MySQL replica nodes that each replicate from multiple primary servers. This is a powerful way to aggregate the replication of multiple MySQL clusters. This topology requires the use of GTIDs.
+
A {prodname} MySQL connector can use these multi-primary MySQL replicas as sources, and can fail over to different multi-primary MySQL replicas as long as the new replica is caught up to the old replica. That is, the new replica has all transactions that were seen on the first replica. This works even if the connector is using only a subset of databases and/or tables, as the connector can be configured to include or exclude specific GTID sources when attempting to reconnect to a new multi-primary MySQL replica and find the correct position in the binlog.

Hosted::
There is support for the {prodname} MySQL connector to use hosted options such as Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora.
+
Because these hosted options do not allow a global read lock, table-level locks are used to create the _consistent snapshot_.

// Type: concept
// ModuleID: how-debezium-mysql-connectors-handle-database-schema-changes
// Title: How {prodname} MySQL connectors handle database schema changes
[[mysql-schema-history-topic]]
=== Schema history topic

When a database client queries a database, the client uses the database’s current schema. However, the database schema can be changed at any time, which means that the connector must be able to identify what the schema was at the time each insert, update, or delete operation was recorded. Also, a connector cannot just use the current schema because the connector might be processing events that are relatively old and may have been recorded before the tables' schemas were changed. 

To handle this, MySQL includes in the binlog not only the row-level changes to the data, but also the DDL statements that are applied to the database. As the connector reads the binlog and comes across these DDL statements, it parses them and updates an in-memory representation of each table’s schema. The connector uses this schema representation to identify the structure of the tables at the time of each insert, update, or delete operation and to produce the appropriate change event. In a separate database history Kafka topic, the connector records all DDL statements along with the position in the binlog where each DDL statement appeared.

When the connector restarts after having crashed or been stopped gracefully, the connector starts reading the binlog from a specific position, that is, from a specific point in time. The connector rebuilds the table structures that existed at this point in time by reading the database history Kafka topic and parsing all DDL statements up to the point in the binlog where the connector is starting.

This database history topic is for connector use only. The connector can optionally See {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-schema-change-topic[emit schema change events to a different topic that is intended for consumer applications].

When the MySQL connector captures changes in a table to which a schema change tool such as `gh-ost` or `pt-online-schema-change` is applied there are helper tables created during the migration process. The connector needs to be configured to capture change to these helper tables. If consumers do not need the records generated for helper tables then a simple message transform can be applied to filter them out.

See {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-topic-names[default names for topics] that receive {prodname} event records.

[id="mysql-schema-change-topic"]
=== Schema change topic

You can configure a {prodname} MySQL connector to produce schema change events that include all DDL statements applied to databases in the MySQL server. The connector emits these events to a Kafka topic named _serverName_ where _serverName_ is the name of the connector as specified by the `database.server.name` connector configuration property.

If you choose to use _schema change events_, ensure that you consume records from the schema change topic. The database history topic is for connector use only. 

IMPORTANT: A global order for events emitted to the schema change topic is vital. Therefore, you must not partition the database history topic. This means that you must specify a partition count of `1` when creating the database history topic. When relying on auto topic creation, make sure that Kafka’s `num.partitions` configuration option, which specifies the default number of partitions, is set to `1`.

Each record that the connector emits to the schema change topic contains a message key that includes the name of the connected database when the DDL statement was applied, for example: 

[source,json,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "struct",
    "name": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.SchemaChangeKey",
    "optional": false,
    "fields": [
      {
        "field": "databaseName",

        "optional": false
      }
    ]
  },
  "payload": {
    "databaseName": "inventory"
  }
}
----

The schema change event record value contains a structure that includes the DDL statements, the name of the database to which the statements were applied, and the position in the binlog where the statements appeared, for example:

    }
  }
}
----

The `ddl` field might contain multiple DDL statements. Each statement applies to the database in the `databaseName` field. The statements appear in the order in which they were applied to the database. The `source` field is structured exactly as a standard data change event written to table-specific topics. This field is useful to correlate events on different topics.

[source,json,subs="+attributes"]
----

"payload": {
    "databaseName": "inventory",
    "ddl": "CREATE TABLE products ( id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,...)",
    "source" : {
        ...
    }
}
....
----

A client can submit multiple DDL statements to be applied to multiple databases. If MySQL applies them atomically, the connector takes the DDL statements in order, groups them by database, and creates a schema change event for each group. If MySQL applies them individually, the connector creates a separate schema change event for each statement.

[[mysql-snapshots]]
=== Snapshots

When a {prodname} MySQL connector is first started, it performs an initial _consistent snapshot_ of your database. The following flow describes how the connector creates this snapshot. This flow is for the default snapshot mode, which is `initial`. For information about other snapshot modes, see the {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-property-snapshot-mode[MySQL connector `snapshot.mode` configuration property].

.Workflow for performing an initial snapshot with a global read lock
[cols="1,9",options="header",subs="+attributes"]
|===
|Step |Action

|1
a| Grabs a global read lock that blocks _writes_ by other database clients. +
 + 
The snapshot itself does not prevent other clients from applying DDL that might interfere with the connector's attempt to read the binlog position and table schemas. The connector keeps the global read lock while it reads the binlog position, and releases the lock as described in a later step.

|2
a|Starts a transaction with link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{mysql-version}/en/innodb-consistent-read.html[repeatable read semantics] to ensure that all subsequent reads within the transaction are done against the _consistent snapshot_.

|3
a|Reads the current binlog position.

|4
a|Reads the schema of the databases and tables for which the connector is configured to capture changes.

|5
a|Releases the global read lock. Other database clients can now write to the database.

|6
a|If applicable, writes the DDL changes to the schema change topic, including all necessary `DROP...` and `CREATE...` DDL statements. 

|7
a|Scans the database tables. For each row, the connector emits `CREATE` events to the relevant table-specific Kafka topics.

|8
a|Commits the transaction.

|9
a|Records the completed snapshot in the connector offsets.

|===

Connector restarts::
If the connector fails, stops, or is rebalanced while performing the _initial snapshot_, then after the connector restarts, it performs a new snapshot. After that _intial snapshot_ is completed, the {prodname} MySQL connector restarts from the same position in the binlog so it does not miss any updates.
+
If the connector stops for long enough, MySQL could purge old binlog files and the connector's position would be lost. If the position is lost, the connector reverts to the _initial snapshot_ for its starting position. For more tips on troubleshooting the {prodname} MySQL connector, see {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-when-things-go-wrong[behavior when things go wrong].

Global read locks not allowed::
Some environments do not allow global read locks. If the {prodname} MySQL connector detects that global read locks are not permitted, the connector uses table-level locks instead and performs a snapshot with this method. This requires the database user for the {prodname} connector to have `LOCK_TABLES` privileges.

// Title: Default names of Kafka topics that receive {prodname} MySQL change event records
[[mysql-topic-names]]
=== Topic names

The default behavior is that a {prodname} MySQL connector writes events for all `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations in one table to one Kafka topic. The Kafka topic naming convention is as follows:

_serverName.databaseName.tableName_

Suppose that `fulfillment` is the server name, `inventory` is the database name, and the database contains tables named `orders`, `customers`, and `products`. The {prodname} MySQL connector emits events to three Kafka topics, one for each table in the database:

----
fulfillment.inventory.orders
fulfillment.inventory.customers
fulfillment.inventory.products
----

// Type: assembly
// ModuleID: descriptions-of-debezium-mysql-connector-data-change-events
// Title: Descriptions of {prodname} MySQL connector data change events
[[mysql-events]]
== Data change events

The {prodname} MySQL connector generates a data change event for each row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operation. Each event contains a key and a value. The structure of the key and the value depends on the table that was changed. 

{prodname} and Kafka Connect are designed around _continuous streams of event messages_. However, the structure of these events may change over time, which can be difficult for consumers to handle. To address this, each event contains the schema for its content or, if you are using a schema registry, a schema ID that a consumer can use to obtain the schema from the registry. This makes each event self-contained. 

The following skeleton JSON shows the basic four parts of a change event. However, how you configure the Kafka Connect converter that you choose to use in your application determines the representation of these four parts in change events. A `schema` field is in a change event only when you configure the converter to produce it. Likewise, the event key and event payload are in a change event only if you configure a converter to produce it. If you use the JSON converver and you configure it to produce all four basic change event parts, change events have this structure: 

[source,json,index=0]
----
{
 "schema": { //<1>
   ...
  },
 "payload": { //<2>
   ...
 },
 "schema": { //<3> 
   ...
 },
 "payload": { //<4>
   ...
 },
}
----

.Overview of change event basic content
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`schema`
|The first `schema` field is part of the event key. It specifies a Kafka Connect schema that describes what is in the event key's `payload` portion. In other words, the first `schema` field describes the structure of the primary key, or the unique key if the table does not have a primary key, for the table that was changed. +
 +
It is possible to override the table's primary key by setting the {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-property-message-key-columns[`message.key.columns` connector configuration property]. In this case, the first schema field describes the structure of the key identified by that property.

|2
|`payload`
|The first `payload` field is part of the event key. It has the structure described by the previous `schema` field and it contains the key for the row that was changed. 

|3
|`schema`
|The second `schema` field is part of the event value. It specifies the Kafka Connect schema that describes what is in the event value's `payload` portion. In other words, the second `schema` describes the structure of the row that was changed. Typically, this schema contains nested schemas. 

|4
|`payload`
|The second `payload` field is part of the event value. It has the structure described by the previous `schema` field and it contains the actual data for the row that was changed.

|===

By default, the connector streams change event records to topics with names that are the same as the event's originating table. See {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-topic-names[topic names].

[WARNING]
====
The MySQL connector ensures that all Kafka Connect schema names adhere to the link:http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#names[Avro schema name format]. This means that the logical server name must start with a Latin letter or an underscore, that is, a-z, A-Z, or pass:[_]. Each remaining character in the logical server name and each character in the database and table names must be a Latin letter, a digit, or an underscore, that is, a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or pass:[_]. If there is an invalid character it is replaced with an underscore character.

This can lead to unexpected conflicts if the logical server name, a database name, or a table name contains invalid characters, and the only characters that distinguish names from one another are invalid and thus replaced with underscores.

[[mysql-change-event-keys]]
=== Change event keys

A change event's key contains the schema for the changed table's key and the changed row's actual key. Both the schema and its corresponding payload contain a field for each column in the changed table's `PRIMARY KEY` (or unique constraint) at the time the connector created the event.

Consider the following `customers` table, which is followed by an example of a change event key for this table. 

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY
) AUTO_INCREMENT=1001;
----

Every change event that captures a change to the `customers` table has the same event key schema. For as long as the `customers` table has the previous definition, every change event that captures a change to the `customers` table has the following key structure. In JSON, it looks like this:

[source,json,index=0]
----
{
 "schema": { <1>
    "type": "struct",
    "name": "mysql-server-1.inventory.customers.Key", <2>
    "optional": false, <3>
    "fields": [ <4>
      {
        "field": "id",
        "type": "int32",
        "optional": false
      }
    ]
  },
 "payload": { <5>
    "id": 1001
  }
}
----

.Description of change event key
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`schema`
|The schema portion of the key specifies a Kafka Connect schema that describes what is in the key's `payload` portion. 

|2
|`mysql-server-1.inventory.customers.Key`
a|Name of the schema that defines the structure of the key's payload. This schema describes the structure of the primary key for the table that was changed. Key schema names have the format _connector-name_._database-name_._table-name_.`Key`. In this example: + 

* `mysql-server-1` is the name of the connector that generated this event. + 
* `inventory` is the database that contains the table that was changed. +
* `customers` is the table that was updated.

|3
|`optional`
|Indicates whether the event key must contain a value in its `payload` field. In this example, a value in the key's payload is required. A value in the key's payload field is optional when a table does not have a primary key.

|4
|`fields` 
|Specifies each field that is expected in the `payload`, including each field's name, type, and whether it is required.

|5
|`payload`
|Contains the key for the row for which this change event was generated. In this example, the key, contains a single `id` field whose value is `1001`.

// Type: concept
// ModuleID: about-values-in-debezium-mysql-change-events
// Title: About values in {prodname} MySQL change events
[[mysql-change-event-values]]
=== Change event values

The value in a change event is a bit more complicated than the key. Like the key, the value has a `schema` section and a `payload` section. The `schema` section contains the schema that describes the `Envelope` structure of the `payload` section, including its nested fields. Change events for operations that create, update or delete data all have a value payload with an envelope structure. 

Consider the same sample table that was used to show an example of a change event key: 

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY
) AUTO_INCREMENT=1001;
----

The value portion of a change event for a change to this table is described for: 

* <<mysql-create-events,_create_ events>>
* <<mysql-update-events,_update_ events>>
* <<mysql-primary-key-updates,Primary key updates>>
* <<mysql-delete-events,_delete_ events>>
* <<mysql-tombstone-events,Tombstone events>>

.Descriptions of _create_ event value fields
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`schema`
|The value's schema, which describes the structure of the value's payload. A change event's value schema is the same in every change event that the connector generates for a particular table. 

|2
|`name`
a|In the `schema` section, each `name` field specifies the schema for a field in the value's payload. +
 +
`mysql-server-1.inventory.customers.Value` is the schema for the payload's `before` and `after` fields. This schema is specific to the `customers` table. +
 +
Names of schemas for `before` and `after` fields are of the form `_logicalName_._tableName_.Value`, which ensures that the schema name is unique in the database. This means that when using the {link-prefix}:{link-avro-serialization}[Avro converter], the resulting Avro schema for each table in each logical source has its own evolution and history.

|3
|`name`
|`io.debezium.connector.mysql.Source` is the schema for the payload's `source` field. This schema is specific to the MySQL connector. The connector uses it for all events that it generates. 

|4
|`name`
|`mysql-server-1.inventory.customers.Envelope` is the schema for the overall structure of the payload, where `mysql-server-1` is the connector name, `inventory` is the database, and `customers` is the table.

|5
|`payload`
|The value's actual data. This is the information that the change event is providing. +
 +
It may appear that the JSON representations of the events are much larger than the rows they describe. This is because the JSON representation must include the schema and the payload portions of the message.
However, by using the {link-prefix}:{link-avro-serialization}[Avro converter], you can significantly decrease the size of the messages that the connector streams to Kafka topics.

|6
|`op`
a| Mandatory string that describes the type of operation that caused the connector to generate the event. In this example, `c` indicates that the operation created a row. Valid values are: 

* `c` = create
* `u` = update
* `d` = delete
* `r` = read (applies to only snapshots)

|7
|`ts_ms`
a| Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event. The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.  +
 +
In the `source` object, `ts_ms` indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for `payload.source.ts_ms` with the value for `payload.ts_ms`, you can determine the lag between the source database update and {prodname}.

|8
|`before`
| An optional field that specifies the state of the row before the event occurred. When the `op` field is `c` for create, as it is in this example, the `before` field is `null` since this change event is for new content. 

|9
|`after`
| An optional field that specifies the state of the row after the event occurred. In this example, the `after` field contains the values of the new row's `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` columns.

|10
|`source`
a| Mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event. This field contains information that you can use to compare this event with other events, with regard to the origin of the events, the order in which the events occurred, and whether events were part of the same transaction. The source metadata includes: 

* {prodname} version
* Connector name
* binlog name where the event was recorded
* binlog position
* Row within the event
* If the event was part of a snapshot
* Name of the database and table that contain the new row
* ID of the MySQL thread that created the event (non-snapshot only)
* MySQL server ID (if available)
* Timestamp for when the change was made in the database

If the {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#enable-query-log-events[`binlog_rows_query_log_events`] MySQL configuration option is enabled and the connector configuration `include.query` property is enabled, the `source` field also provides the `query` field, which contains the original SQL statement that caused the change event.

// Type: continue
[id="mysql-update-events"]
=== _update_ events

The value of a change event for an update in the sample `customers` table has the same schema as a _create_ event for that table. Likewise, the event value's payload has the same structure. However, the event value payload contains different values in an _update_ event. Here is an example of a change event value in an event that the connector generates for an update in the `customers` table:

.Descriptions of _update_ event value fields
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`before`
|An optional field that specifies the state of the row before the event occurred. In an _update_ event value, the `before` field contains a field for each table column and the value that was in that column before the database commit. In this example, the `first_name` value is `Anne.`

|2
|`after`
| An optional field that specifies the state of the row after the event occurred. You can compare the `before` and `after` structures to determine what the update to this row was. In the example, the `first_name` value is now `Anne Marie`. 

|3
|`source`
a|Mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event. The `source` field structure has the same fields as in a _create_ event, but some values are different, for example, the sample _update_ event is from a different position in the binlog. The source metadata includes: 

* {prodname} version
* Connector name
* binlog name where the event was recorded
* binlog position
* Row within the event
* If the event was part of a snapshot
* Name of the database and table that contain the updated row
* ID of the MySQL thread that created the event (non-snapshot only)
* MySQL server ID (if available)
* Timestamp for when the change was made in the database

If the {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#enable-query-log-events[`binlog_rows_query_log_events`] MySQL configuration option is enabled and the connector configuration `include.query` property is enabled, the `source` field also provides the `query` field, which contains the original SQL statement that caused the change event.

|4
|`op`
a|Mandatory string that describes the type of operation. In an _update_ event value, the `op` field value is `u`, signifying that this row changed because of an update.

|5
|`ts_ms`
a| Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event. The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.  +
 +
In the `source` object, `ts_ms` indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for `payload.source.ts_ms` with the value for `payload.ts_ms`, you can determine the lag between the source database update and {prodname}.

|===

[NOTE]
====
Updating the columns for a row's primary/unique key changes the value of the row's key. When a key changes, {prodname} outputs _three_ events: a `DELETE` event and a {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-tombstone-events[tombstone event] with the old key for the row, followed by an event with the new key for the row. Details are in the next section.

// Type: continue
[id="mysql-primary-key-updates"]
=== Primary key updates

An `UPDATE` operation that changes a row's primary key field(s) is known
as a primary key change. For a primary key change, in place of an `UPDATE` event record, the connector emits a `DELETE` event record for the old key and a `CREATE` event record for the new (updated) key. These events have the usual structure and content, and in addition, each one has a message header related to the primary key change: 

* The `DELETE` event record has `__debezium.newkey` as a message header. The value of this header is the new primary key for the updated row.

* The `CREATE` event record has `__debezium.oldkey` as a message header. The value of this header is the previous (old) primary key that the updated row had.

// Type: continue
[id="mysql-delete-events"]
=== _delete_ events

The value in a _delete_ change event has the same `schema` portion as _create_ and _update_ events for the same table. The `payload` portion in a _delete_ event for the sample `customers` table looks like this:

.Descriptions of _delete_ event value fields
[cols="1,2,7",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Field name |Description

|1
|`before`
|Optional field that specifies the state of the row before the event occurred. In a _delete_ event value, the `before` field contains the values that were in the row before it was deleted with the database commit.

|2
|`after`
| Optional field that specifies the state of the row after the event occurred. In a _delete_ event value, the `after` field is `null`, signifying that the row no longer exists.

|3
|`source`
a|Mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event. In a _delete_ event value, the `source` field structure is the same as for _create_ and _update_ events for the same table. Many `source` field values are also the same. In a _delete_ event value, the `ts_ms` and `pos` field values, as well as other values, might have changed. But the `source` field in a _delete_ event value provides the same metadata: 

* {prodname} version
* Connector name
* binlog name where the event was recorded
* binlog position
* Row within the event
* If the event was part of a snapshot
* Name of the database and table that contain the updated row
* ID of the MySQL thread that created the event (non-snapshot only)
* MySQL server ID (if available)
* Timestamp for when the change was made in the database

If the {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#enable-query-log-events[`binlog_rows_query_log_events`] MySQL configuration option is enabled and the connector configuration `include.query` property is enabled, the `source` field also provides the `query` field, which contains the original SQL statement that caused the change event.

|4
|`op`
a|Mandatory string that describes the type of operation. The `op` field value is `d`, signifying that this row was deleted.

|5
|`ts_ms`
a|Optional field that displays the time at which the connector processed the event. The time is based on the system clock in the JVM running the Kafka Connect task.  +
 +
In the `source` object, `ts_ms` indicates the time that the change was made in the database. By comparing the value for `payload.source.ts_ms` with the value for `payload.ts_ms`, you can determine the lag between the source database update and {prodname}.

|===

A _delete_ change event record provides a consumer with the information it needs to process the removal of this row. The old values are included because some consumers might require them in order to properly handle the removal.

MySQL connector events are designed to work with link:{link-kafka-docs}/#compaction[Kafka log compaction]. Log compaction enables removal of some older messages as long as at least the most recent message for every key is kept. This lets Kafka reclaim storage space while ensuring that the topic contains a complete data set and can be used for reloading key-based state.

// Type: continue
[id="mysql-tombstone-events"]
=== Tombstone events
When a row is deleted, the _delete_ event value still works with log compaction, because Kafka can remove all earlier messages that have that same key. However, for Kafka to remove all messages that have that same key, the message value must be `null`. To make this possible, after {prodname}’s MySQL connector emits a _delete_ event, the connector emits a special tombstone event that has the same key but a `null` value.

// Title: How {prodname} MySQL connectors map data types
[[mysql-data-types]]
== Data type mappings

The {prodname} MySQL connector represents changes to rows with events that are structured like the table in which the row exists. The event contains a field for each column value. The MySQL data type of that column dictates how {prodname} represents the value in the event.

Columns that store strings are defined in MySQL with a character set and collation. The MySQL connector uses the column's character set when reading the binary representation of the column values in the binlog events. 

The connector can map MySQL data types to both _literal_ and _semantic_ types.

* *Literal type*: how the value is represented using Kafka Connect schema types
* *Semantic type*: how the Kafka Connect schema captures the meaning of the field (schema name)

[id="mysql-temporal-types"]
=== Temporal types

Excluding the `TIMESTAMP` data type, MySQL temporal types depend on the value of the `time.precision.mode` connector configuration property. For `TIMESTAMP` columns whose default value is specified as `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` or `NOW`, the value `1970-01-01 00:00:00` is used as the default value in the Kafka Connect schema. 

MySQL allows zero-values for `DATE, `DATETIME`, and `TIMESTAMP` columns because zero-values are sometimes preferred over null values. The MySQL connector represents zero-values as null values when the column definition allows null values, or as the epoch day when the column does not allow null values.

.Temporal values without time zones
The `DATETIME` type represents a local date and time such as "2018-01-13 09:48:27". As you can see, there is no time zone information. Such columns are converted into epoch milliseconds or microseconds based on the column’s precision by using UTC. The `TIMESTAMP` type represents a timestamp without time zone information. It is converted by MySQL from the server (or session’s) current time zone into UTC when writing and from UTC into the server (or session's) current time zone when reading back the value. For example:

* `DATETIME` with a value of `2018-06-20 06:37:03` becomes `1529476623000`.
* `TIMESTAMP` with a value of `2018-06-20 06:37:03` becomes `2018-06-20T13:37:03Z`.

Such columns are converted into an equivalent `io.debezium.time.ZonedTimestamp` in UTC based on the server (or session’s) current time zone. The time zone will be queried from the server by default. If this fails, it must be specified explicitly by the database `serverTimezone` MySQL configuration option. For example, if the database’s time zone (either globally or configured for the connector by means of the `serverTimezone` option) is "America/Los_Angeles", the TIMESTAMP value "2018-06-20 06:37:03" is represented by a `ZonedTimestamp` with the value "2018-06-20T13:37:03Z".

The time zone of the JVM running Kafka Connect and Debezium does not affect these conversions.

More details about properties related to termporal values are in the documentation for {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-connector-properties[MySQL connector configuration properties].

time.precision.mode=adaptive_time_microseconds(default)::
The MySQL connector determines the literal type and semantic type based on the column's data type definition so that events represent exactly the values in the database. All time fields are in microseconds. Only positive `TIME` field values in the range of `00:00:00.000000` to `23:59:59.999999` can be captured correctly.

time.precision.mode=connect::
The MySQL connector uses defined Kafka Connect logical types. This approach is less precise than the default approach and the events could be less precise if the database column has a _fractional second precision_ value of greater than `3`. Values in only the range of `00:00:00.000` to `23:59:59.999` can be handled. Set `time.precision.mode=connect` only if you can ensure that the `TIME` values in your tables never exceed the supported ranges. The `connect` setting is expected to be removed in a future version of {prodname}.

[id="mysql-boolean-values"]
=== Boolean values

MySQL handles the `BOOLEAN` value internally in a specific way.
The `BOOLEAN` column is internally mapped to the `TINYINT(1)` data type.
When the table is created during streaming then it uses proper `BOOLEAN` mapping as {prodname} receives the original DDL.
During snapshots, {prodname} executes `SHOW CREATE TABLE` to obtain table definitions that return `TINYINT(1)` for both `BOOLEAN` and `TINYINT(1)` columns. {prodname} then has no way to obtain the original type mapping and so maps to `TINYINT(1)`.

ifdef::community[]
The operator can configure the out-of-the-box {link-prefix}:{link-custom-converters}[`TinyIntOneToBooleanConverter` custom converter] that would either map all `TINYINT(1)` columns to `BOOLEAN` or if the `selector` parameter is set then a subset of columns could be enumerated using comma-separated regular expressions.
endif::community[]

Following is an example configuration:

[[mysql-creating-user]]
=== Creating a user 

A {prodname} MySQL connector requires a MySQL user account. This MySQL user must have appropriate permissions on all databases for which the {prodname} MySQL connector captures changes.

.Prerequisites

* A MySQL server.
* Basic knowledge of SQL commands.

.Procedure

. Create the MySQL user:
+
[source,SQL]
----
mysql> CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
----

. Grant the required permissions to the user:
+
[source,SQL]
----
mysql> GRANT SELECT, RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'user' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
----
+
The table below describes the permissions. 
+
IMPORTANT: If using a hosted option such as Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora that does not allow a global read lock, table-level locks are used to create the _consistent snapshot_. In this case, you need to also grant `LOCK_TABLES` permissions to the user that you create. See {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-snapshots[snapshots] for more details.

. Finalize the user's permissions:
+
[source,SQL]
----
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
----

|===
|Keyword |Description

|`SELECT`
|Enables the connector to select rows from tables in databases. This is used only when performing a snapshot.

|`RELOAD`
|Enables the connector the use of the `FLUSH` statement to clear or reload internal caches, flush tables, or acquire locks. This is used only when performing a snapshot.

|`SHOW DATABASES`
|Enables the connector to see database names by issuing the `SHOW DATABASE` statement. This is used only when performing a snapshot.

|`REPLICATION SLAVE`
|Enables the connector to connect to and read the MySQL server binlog.

|`REPLICATION CLIENT`
a|Enables the connector the use of the following statements:

* `SHOW MASTER STATUS`
* `SHOW SLAVE STATUS`
* `SHOW BINARY LOGS`

The connector always requires this.

|`ON`
|Identifies the database to which the permissions apply.

|`TO 'user'`
|Specifies the user to grant the permissions to.

|`IDENTIFIED BY 'password'`
|Specifies the user's MySQL password.

|Item |Description

|1
|The name of the connector.

|2
|Only one task should operate at any one time.
Because the MySQL connector reads the MySQL server’s `binlog`,
using a single connector task ensures proper order and event handling.
The Kafka Connect service uses connectors to start one or more tasks that do the work,
and it automatically distributes the running tasks across the cluster of Kafka Connect services.
If any of the services stop or crash,
those tasks will be redistributed to running services.

|3
|The connector’s configuration.

|4
|The database host, which is the name of the container running the MySQL server (`mysql`).

|5
|A unique server ID and name.
The server name is the logical identifier for the MySQL server or cluster of servers.
This name is used as the prefix for all Kafka topics.

|6
|Changes in only the `inventory` database are captured.

|7
|The connector stores the history of the database schemas in Kafka using this broker (the same broker to which you are sending events) and topic name.
Upon restart, the connector recovers the schemas of the database that existed at the point in time in the binlog when the connector should begin reading.

=== Adding connector configuration 
ifdef::community[]
To start running a MySQL connector, configure a connector and add the configuration to your Kafka Connect cluster. 

.Prerequisites

* {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#setting-up-mysql[MySQL server] is 
set up for a {prodname} connector.

* {prodname} MySQL connector is installed. 

.Procedure

. Create a configuration for the MySQL connector.

. Use the link:{link-kafka-docs}/#connect_rest[Kafka Connect REST API] to add that connector configuration to your Kafka Connect cluster. 

endif::community[]

ifdef::product[]
You can use a provided {prodname} container to deploy a {prodname} MySQL connector. In this procedure, you build a custom Kafka Connect container image for {prodname}, configure the {prodname} connector as needed, and then add your connector configuration to your Kafka Connect environment. 

.Prerequisites

* Podman or Docker is installed.
* You have sufficient rights to create and manage containers.
* You downloaded the {prodname} MySQL connector archive. 

.Procedure

. Extract the {prodname} MySQL connector archive to create a directory structure for the connector plug-in, for example: 
+
[subs="+macros"]
----
pass:quotes[*tree ./my-plugins/*]
./my-plugins/
├── debezium-connector-mysql
│   ├── ...
----

. Create and publish a custom image for running your {prodname} connector:

.. Create a new `Dockerfile` by using `{DockerKafkaConnect}` as the base image. In the following example, you would replace _my-plugins_ with the name of your plug-ins directory:
+
[subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
FROM {DockerKafkaConnect}
USER root:root
pass:quotes[COPY _./my-plugins/_ /opt/kafka/plugins/]
USER 1001
----

Before Kafka Connect starts running the connector, Kafka Connect loads any third-party plug-ins that are in the `/opt/kafka/plugins` directory.

.. Build the container image. For example, if you saved the `Dockerfile` that you created in the previous step as `debezium-container-for-mysql`, and if `Dockerfile` is in the current directory, then you would run the following command:
+
`podman build -t debezium-container-for-mysql:latest .`

.. Push your custom image to your container registry, for example:
+
`podman push debezium-container-for-mysql:latest`

.. Point to the new container image. Do one of the following:
+
* Edit the `spec.image` property of the `KafkaConnector` custom resource. If set, this property overrides the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE` variable in the Cluster Operator. For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaConnectApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnector
metadata:
  name: my-connect-cluster
spec:
  #...
  image: debezium-container-for-mysql
----
+
* In the `install/cluster-operator/050-Deployment-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml` file, edit the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE` variable to point to the new container image and reinstall the Cluster Operator. If you edit this file you must apply it to your OpenShift cluster.

. Create a `KafkaConnector` custom resource that defines your {prodname} MySQL connector instance. See {LinkDebeziumUserGuide}#mysql-example-configuration[the connector configuration example].

. Apply the connector instance, for example: 
+
`oc apply -f inventory-connector.yaml`
+
This registers `inventory-connector` and the connector starts to run against the `inventory` database.

. Verify that the connector was created and has started to capture changes in the specified database. You can verify the connector instance by watching the Kafka Connect log output as, for example, `inventory-connector` starts.

.. Display the Kafka Connect log output:
+
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
oc logs $(oc get pods -o name -l strimzi.io/name=my-connect-cluster-connect)
----

.. Review the log output to verify that the initial snapshot has been executed. You should see something like the following lines: 
+
[source,shell,options="nowrap"]
----
... INFO Starting snapshot for ...
... INFO Snapshot is using user 'debezium' ... 
----

endif::product[]

.Results

When the connector starts, it {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-snapshots[performs a consistent snapshot] of the MySQL databases that the connector is configured for. The connector then starts generating data change events for row-level operations and streaming change event records to Kafka topics.

=== Connector properties

The {prodname} MySQL connector has numerous configuration properties that you can use to achieve the right connector behavior for your application. Many properties have default values. Information about the properties is organized as follows:

* xref:mysql-required-connector-configuration-properties[Required connector configuration properties]
* xref:mysql-advanced-connector-configuration-properties[Advanced connector configuration properties]
* xref:mysql-pass-through-configuration-properties[Pass-through configuration properties]

[id="mysql-required-connector-configuration-properties"]
The following configuration properties are _required_ unless a default value is available.

[cols="33%a,17%a,50%a",options="header",subs="+attributes"]
|===
|Property |Default |Description

|[[mysql-property-name]]<<mysql-property-name, `name`>>
|
|Unique name for the connector. Attempting to register again with the same name fails. This property is required by all Kafka Connect connectors.

|[[mysql-property-connector-class]]<<mysql-property-connector-class, `connector.class`>>
|
|The name of the Java class for the connector. Always specify  `io.debezium{zwsp}.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector` for the MySQL connector.

|[[mysql-property-tasks-max]]<<mysql-property-tasks-max, `tasks.max`>>
|`1`
|The maximum number of tasks that should be created for this connector. The MySQL connector always uses a single task and therefore does not use this value, so the default is always acceptable.

|[[mysql-property-database-hostname]]<<mysql-property-database-hostname, `database.hostname`>>
|
|IP address or host name of the MySQL database server.

|[[mysql-property-database-port]]<<mysql-property-database-port, `database.port`>>
|`3306`
|Integer port number of the MySQL database server.

|[[mysql-property-database-user]]<<mysql-property-database-user, `database.user`>>
|
|Name of the MySQL database to use when connecting to the MySQL database server.

|[[mysql-property-database-password]]<<mysql-property-database-password, `database.password`>>
|
|Password to use when connecting to the MySQL database server.

|[[mysql-property-database-server-name]]<<mysql-property-database-server-name, `database.server.name`>>
|
|Logical name that identifies and provides a namespace for the particular MySQL database server/cluster in which {prodname} is capturing changes. The logical name should be unique across all other connectors, since it is used as a prefix for all Kafka topic names that receive events emitted by this connector.
Only alphanumeric characters and underscores are allowed in this name.

|[[mysql-property-database-server-id]]<<mysql-property-database-server-id, `database.server.id`>>
|_random_
|A numeric ID of this database client, which must be unique across all currently-running database processes in the MySQL cluster. This connector joins the MySQL database cluster as another server (with this unique ID) so it can read the binlog. By default, a random number between 5400 and 6400 is generated, though the recommendation is to explicitly set a value.  

|[[mysql-property-database-history-kafka-topic]]<<mysql-property-database-history-kafka-topic, `database.history.kafka{zwsp}.topic`>>
|
|The full name of the Kafka topic where the connector stores the database schema history.

|[[mysql-property-database-history-kafka-bootstrap-servers]]<<mysql-property-database-history-kafka-bootstrap-servers, `database.history{zwsp}.kafka.bootstrap{zwsp}.servers`>>
|
|A list of host/port pairs that the connector uses for establishing an initial connection to the Kafka cluster. This connection is used for retrieving database schema history previously stored by the connector, and for writing each DDL statement read from the source database. Each pair should point to the same Kafka cluster used by the Kafka Connect process.

|[[mysql-property-database-whitelist]]
[[mysql-property-database-include-list]]<<mysql-property-database-include-list, `database.include.list`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the names of the databases for which to capture changes. The connector does not capture changes in any database whose name is not in `database.include.list`. By default, the connector captures changes in all databases. 
Do not also set the `database.exclude.list` connector confiuration property.

|[[mysql-property-database-blacklist]]
[[mysql-property-database-exclude-list]]<<mysql-property-database-exclude-list, `database.exclude.list`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the names of databases for which you do not want to capture changes. The connector captures changes in any database whose name is not in the `database.exclude.list`. 
Do not also set the `database.include.list` connector configuration property.

|[[mysql-property-table-whitelist]]
[[mysql-property-table-include-list]]<<mysql-property-table-include-list, `table.include.list`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified table identifiers of tables whose changes you want to capture. The connector does not capture changes in any table not included in `table.include.list`. Each identifier is of the form _databaseName_._tableName_. By default, the connector captures changes in every non-system table in each database whose changes are being captured.
Do not also specify the `table.exclude.list` connector configuration property.

|[[mysql-property-table-blacklist]]
[[mysql-property-table-exclude-list]]<<mysql-property-table-exclude-list, `table.exclude.list`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified table identifiers for tables whose changes you do not want to capture. The connector captures changes in any table not included in `table.exclude.list`. Each identifier is of the form _databaseName_._tableName_.
Do not also specify the `table.include.list` connector configuration property.

|[[mysql-property-column-blacklist]]
[[mysql-property-column-exclude-list]]<<mysql-property-column-exclude-list, `column.exclude.list`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns to exclude from change event record values. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_.

|[[mysql-property-column-include-list]]<<mysql-property-column-include-list, `column.include.list`>>
|_empty string_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns to include in change event record values. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_.

|[[mysql-property-column-truncate-to-length-chars]]<<mysql-property-column-truncate-to-length-chars, `column.truncate.to{zwsp}._length_.chars`>>
|_n/a_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of character-based columns whose values should be truncated in the change event record values if the field values are longer than the specified number of characters. You can configure multiple properties with different lengths in a single configuration. The length must be a positive integer. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_.

|[[mysql-property-column-mask-with-length-chars]]<<mysql-property-column-mask-with-length-chars, `column.mask.with{zwsp}._length_.chars`>>
|_n/a_
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of character-based columns whose values should be replaced in the change event message values with a field value consisting of the specified number of asterisk (`*`) characters. You can configure multiple properties with different lengths in a single configuration. Each length must be a positive integer or zero. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_.

|[[mysql-property-column-mask-hash]]<<mysql-property-column-mask-hash, `column.mask{zwsp}.hash._hashAlgorithm_{zwsp}.with.salt._salt_`>>
|_n/a_
a|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of character-based columns whose values should be pseudonyms in the change event record values. Pseudonyms consist of the hashed value obtained by applying the algorithm `_hashAlgorithm_` and salt `_salt_`. +
 +
Based on the hash function used, referential integrity is kept while data is pseudonymized. Supported hash functions are described in the {link-java7-standard-names}[MessageDigest section] of the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation.
The hash result is automatically shortened to the length of the column. +
 +
You can configure multiple properties with different lengths in a single configuration. Each length must be a positive integer or zero. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form _databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_. For example: +
 +
`column.mask.hash.SHA-256.with.salt.CzQMA0cB5K = inventory.orders.customerName, inventory.shipment.customerName` +
 +
`CzQMA0cB5K` is a randomly selected salt.
 +
Depending on the configured `_hashAlgorithm_`, the selected `_salt_`, and the actual data set, the resulting masked data set might not be completely anonymized.

|[[mysql-property-column-propagate-source-type]]<<mysql-property-column-propagate-source-type, `column.propagate{zwsp}.source.type`>>
|_n/a_
a|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns whose original type and length should be added as a parameter to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change event records. These schema parameters: 

`pass:[_]pass:[_]{prodname}.source.column.type` 

`pass:[_]pass:[_]{prodname}.source.column.length` 
 
`pass:[_]pass:[_]{prodname}.source.column.scale` 

are used to propagate the original type name and length for variable-width types, respectively. This is useful to properly size corresponding columns in sink databases. Fully-qualified names for columns are of one of these forms: 

_databaseName_._tableName_._columnName_ 

_databaseName_._schemaName_._tableName_._columnName_

|[[mysql-property-datatype-propagate-source-type]]<<mysql-property-datatype-propagate-source-type, `datatype.propagate{zwsp}.source.type`>>
|_n/a_
a|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the database-specific data type name of columns whose original type and length should be added as a parameter to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change event records. These schema parameters: 
 
`pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.type`  

`pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.length`

`pass:[_]pass:[_]debezium.source.column.scale`  

are used to propagate the original type name and length for variable-width types, respectively. This is useful to properly size corresponding columns in sink databases. Fully-qualified data type names are of one of these forms: 

_databaseName_._tableName_._typeName_ 

_databaseName_._schemaName_._tableName_._typeName_ 
 
See {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-data-types[how MySQL connectors map data types] for the list of MySQL-specific data type names.

|[[mysql-property-time-precision-mode]]<<mysql-property-time-precision-mode, `time.precision.mode`>>
|`adaptive_time{zwsp}_microseconds`
|Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precision, including: +
 +
`adaptive_time_microseconds` (the default) captures the date, datetime and timestamp values exactly as in the database using either millisecond, microsecond, or nanosecond precision values based on the database column's type, with the exception of TIME type fields, which are always captured as microseconds. +
 +
ifdef::community[]
`adaptive` (deprecated) captures the time and timestamp values exactly as in the database using either millisecond, microsecond, or nanosecond precision values based on the database column's type. +
endif::community[]
 +
`connect` always represents time and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which use millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision.

|[[mysql-property-decimal-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-decimal-handling-mode,`decimal.handling.mode`>>
|`precise`
|Specifies how the connector should handle values for `DECIMAL` and `NUMERIC` columns: +
 +
`precise` (the default) represents them precisely using `java.math.BigDecimal` values represented in change events in a binary form. +
 +
`double` represents them using `double` values, which may result in a loss of precision but is easier to use. +
 +
`string` encodes values as formatted strings, which is easy to consume but  semantic information about the real type is lost.

|[[mysql-property-bigint-unsigned-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-bigint-unsigned-handling-mode, `bigint.unsigned{zwsp}.handling.mode`>>
|`long`
|Specifies how BIGINT UNSIGNED columns should be represented in change events. Possible settings are: +
 +
 `long` represents values by using Java's `long`, which might not offer the precision but which is easy to use in consumers. `long` is usually the preferred setting. +
 +
`precise` uses `java.math.BigDecimal` to represent values, which are encoded in the change events by using a binary representation and Kafka Connect's `org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal` type. Use this setting when working with values larger than 2^63, because these values cannot be conveyed by using `long`.

|[[mysql-property-include-schema-changes]]<<mysql-property-include-schema-changes, `include.schema{zwsp}.changes`>>
|`true`
|Boolean value that specifies whether the connector should publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic with the same name as the database server ID. Each schema change is recorded by using a key that contains the database name and whose value includes the DDL statement(s). This is independent of how the connector internally records database history. 

|[[mysql-property-include-query]]<<mysql-property-include-query, `include.query`>>
|`false`
|Boolean value that specifies whether the connector should include the original SQL query that generated the change event. +
 +
If you set this option to `true` then you must also configure MySQL with the `binlog_rows_query_log_events` option set to `ON`. When `include.query` is `true`, the query is not present for events that the snapshot process generates. +
 +
Setting `include.query`to `true` might expose tables or fields explicitly excluded or masked by including the original SQL statement in the change event. For this reason, the default setting is `false`.

|[[mysql-property-event-processing-failure-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-event-processing-failure-handling-mode, `event.processing{zwsp}.failure.handling.mode`>>
|`fail`
|Specifies how the connector should react to exceptions during deserialization of binlog events. +
 +
`fail` propagates the exception, which indicates the problematic event and its binlog offset, and causes the connector to stop. +
 +
`warn` logs the problematic event and its binlog offset and then skips the event. +
 +
`skip` passes over the problematic event and does not log anything.

|[[mysql-property-inconsistent-schema-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-inconsistent-schema-handling-mode, `inconsistent.schema{zwsp}.handling.mode`>>
|`fail`
|Specifies how the connector should react to binlog events that relate to tables that are not present in internal schema representation. That is, the internal representation is not consistent with the database. +
 +
`fail` throws an exception that indicates the problematic event and its binlog offset, and causes the connector to stop. +
 +
`warn` logs the problematic event and its binlog offset and skips the event. +
 +
`skip` passes over the problematic event and does not log anything.

|[[mysql-property-max-queue-size]]<<mysql-property-max-queue-size, `max.queue.size`>>
|`8192`
|Positive integer value that specifies the maximum size of the blocking queue into which change events read from the database log are placed before they are written to Kafka. This queue can provide backpressure to the binlog reader when, for example, writes to Kafka are slow or if Kafka is not available. Events that appear in the queue are not included in the offsets periodically recorded by this connector. Defaults to 8192, and should always be larger than the maximum batch size specified by the `max.batch.size` property.

|[[mysql-property-max-batch-size]]<<mysql-property-max-batch-size, `max.batch.size`>>
|`2048`
|Positive integer value that specifies the maximum size of each batch of events that should be processed during each iteration of this connector. Defaults to 2048.

|[[mysql-property-max-queue-size-in-bytes]]<<mysql-property-max-queue-size-in-bytes, `max.queue.size.in.bytes`>>
|`0`
|Long value for the maximum size in bytes of the blocking queue. The feature is disabled by default, it will be active if it's set with a positive long value.

|[[mysql-property-poll-interval-ms]]<<mysql-property-poll-interval-ms, `poll.interval.ms`>>
|`1000`
|Positive integer value that specifies the number of milliseconds the connector should wait for new change events to appear before it starts processing a batch of events. Defaults to 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second.

|[[mysql-property-connect-timeout-ms]]<<mysql-property-connect-timeout-ms, `connect.timeout.ms`>>
|`30000`
|A positive integer value that specifies the maximum time in milliseconds this connector should wait after trying to connect to the MySQL database server before timing out. Defaults to 30 seconds.

|[[mysql-property-gtid-source-includes]]<<mysql-property-gtid-source-includes, `gtid.source.includes`>>
|
|A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match source UUIDs in the GTID set used to find the binlog position in the MySQL server. Only the GTID ranges that have sources that match one of these include patterns are used.
Do not also specify a setting for `gtid.source.excludes`.

|[[mysql-property-gtid-source-excludes]]<<mysql-property-gtid-source-excludes, `gtid.source.excludes`>>
|
|A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match source UUIDs in the GTID set used to find the binlog position in the MySQL server. Only the GTID ranges that have sources that do not match any of these exclude patterns are used. Do not also specify a value for `gtid.source.includes`.

ifdef::community[]
|[[mysql-property-gtid-new-channel-position]]<<mysql-property-gtid-new-channel-position, `gtid.new.channel.position`>> +
_deprecated and scheduled for removal_
|`earliest`
|When set to `latest`, when the connector sees a new GTID channel, it starts consuming from the last executed transaction in that GTID channel. If set to `earliest` (default), the connector starts reading that channel from the first available (not purged) GTID position. `earliest` is useful when you have an active-passive MySQL setup where {prodname} is connected to the primary server. In this case, during failover, the replica with the new UUID (and GTID channel) starts receiving writes before {prodname} is connected. These writes would be lost when using `latest`.
endif::community[]

|[[mysql-property-tombstones-on-delete]]<<mysql-property-tombstones-on-delete, `tombstones.on.delete`>>
|`true`
|Controls whether a delete event is followed by a tombstone event. +
 +
`true`  - a delete operation is represented by a delete event and a subsequent tombstone event.  +
 +
`false` - only a delete event is emitted. +
 +
After a source record is deleted, emitting a tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events that pertain to the key of the deleted row. 

|[[mysql-property-message-key-columns]]<<mysql-property-message-key-columns, `message.key.columns`>>
|_empty string_
|A semicolon separated list of tables with regular expressions that match table column names. The connector maps values in matching columns to key fields in change event records that it sends to Kafka topics. This is useful when a table does not have a primary key, or when you want to order change event records in a Kafka topic according to a field that is not a primary key. +
 +
Separate entries with semicolons. Insert a colon between the fully-qualified table name and its regular expression. The format (shown with spaces for clarity only) is: +
 +
_database-name_ `.` _table-name_ `:` _regexp_ `;` ... +
 +
For example: +
 +
`dbA.table_a:regex_1;dbB.table_b:regex_2;dbC.table_c:regex_3` +
 +
If `table_a` has an `id` column, and `regex_1` is `^i` (matches any column that starts with `i`), the connector maps the value in the `id` column of `table_a` to a key field in change events that the connector sends to Kafka. 

|[[mysql-property-binary-handling-mode]]<<mysql-property-binary-handling-mode,`binary.handling.mode`>>
|bytes
|Specifies how binary columns, for example, `blob`, `binary`, `varbinary`, should be represented in change events. Possible settings:  +
 +
`bytes` represents binary data as a byte array. +
 +
`base64` represents binary data as a base64-encoded String. +
 +
`hex` represents binary data as a hex-encoded (base16) String.

.Advanced MySQL connector configuration properties

The following table describes {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-advanced-connector-configuration-properties[advanced MySQL connector properties]. The default values for these properties rarely need to be changed. Therefore, you do not need to specify them in the connector configuration.

.Descriptions of MySQL connector advanced configuration properties
[cols="30%a,20%a,50%a",options="header",subs="+attributes"]
|===
|Property |Default |Description

|[[mysql-property-connect-keep-alive]]<<mysql-property-connect-keep-alive, `connect.keep.alive`>>
|`true`
|A Boolean value that specifies whether a separate thread should be used to ensure that the connection to the MySQL server/cluster is kept alive.

|[[mysql-property-table-ignore-builtin]]<<mysql-property-table-ignore-builtin, `table.ignore{zwsp}.builtin`>>
|`true`
|A Boolean value that specifies whether built-in system tables should be ignored. This applies regardless of the table include and exclude lists. By default, system tables are excluded from having their changes captured, and no events are generated when changes are made to any system tables.

|[[mysql-property-database-history-kafka-recovery-poll-interval-ms]]<<mysql-property-database-history-kafka-recovery-poll-interval-ms, `database.history{zwsp}.kafka.recovery{zwsp}.poll.interval.ms`>>
|`100`
|An integer value that specifies the maximum number of milliseconds the connector should wait during startup/recovery while polling for persisted data. The default is 100ms.

|[[mysql-property-database-history-kafka-recovery-attempts]]<<mysql-property-database-history-kafka-recovery-attempts, `database.history{zwsp}.kafka.recovery{zwsp}.attempts`>>
|`4`
|The maximum number of times that the connector should try to read persisted history data before the connector recovery fails with an error. The maximum amount of time to wait after receiving no data is `recovery.attempts` x `recovery.poll.interval.ms`.

|[[mysql-property-database-history-skip-unparseable-ddl]]<<mysql-property-database-history-skip-unparseable-ddl, `database.history{zwsp}.skip.unparseable{zwsp}.ddl`>>
|`false`
|A Boolean value that specifies whether the connector should ignore malformed or unknown database statements or stop processing so a human can fix the issue.
The safe default is `false`.
Skipping should be used only with care as it can lead to data loss or mangling when the binlog is being processed.

|[[mysql-property-database-history-store-only-monitored-tables-ddl]]<<mysql-property-database-history-store-only-monitored-tables-ddl, `database.history{zwsp}.store.only{zwsp}.monitored.tables{zwsp}.ddl`>>
|`false`
|A Boolean value that specifies whether the connector should record all DDL statements  +
 +
`true` records only those DDL statements that are relevant to tables whose changes are being captured by {prodname}. Set to `true` with care because missing data might become necessary if you change which tables have their changes captured. +
 +
The safe default is `false`.

|[[mysql-property-database-ssl-mode]]<<mysql-property-database-ssl-mode, `database.ssl.mode`>>
|`disabled`
|Specifies whether to use an encrypted connection. Possible settings are: +
 +
`disabled` specifies the use of an unencrypted connection. +
 +
`preferred` establishes an encrypted connection if the server supports secure connections. If the server does not support secure connections, falls back to an unencrypted connection. +
 +
`required` establishes an encrypted connection or fails if one cannot be made for any reason. +
 +
`verify_ca` behaves like `required` but additionally it verifies the server TLS certificate against the configured Certificate Authority (CA) certificates and fails if the server TLS certificate does not match any valid CA certificates. +
 +
`verify_identity` behaves like `verify_ca` but additionally verifies that the server certificate matches the host of the remote connection.

|[[mysql-property-binlog-buffer-size]]<<mysql-property-binlog-buffer-size, `binlog.buffer.size`>>
|0
|The size of a look-ahead buffer used by the binlog reader. The default setting of `0` disables buffering. +
 +
Under specific conditions, it is possible that the MySQL binlog contains uncommitted data finished by a `ROLLBACK` statement.
Typical examples are using savepoints or mixing temporary and regular table changes in a single transaction. +
 +
When a beginning of a transaction is detected then {prodname} tries to roll forward the binlog position and find either `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` so it can determine whether to stream the changes from the transaction.
The size of the binlog buffer defines the maximum number of changes in the transaction that {prodname} can buffer while searching for transaction boundaries.
If the size of the transaction is larger than the buffer then {prodname} must rewind and re-read the events that have not fit into the buffer while streaming. +
 +
NOTE: This feature is incubating. Feedback is encouraged. It is expected that this feature is not completely polished.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-mode]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-mode, `snapshot.mode`>>
|`initial`
|Specifies the criteria for running a snapshot when the connector starts. Possible settings are: +
 +
`initial` - the connector runs a snapshot only when no offsets have been recorded for the logical server name. +
 +
`when_needed` - the connector runs a snapshot upon startup whenever it deems it necessary. That is, when no offsets are available, or when a previously recorded offset specifies a binlog location or GTID that is not available in the server. +
 +
`never` - the connector never uses snapshots. Upon first startup with a logical server name, the connector reads from the beginning of the binlog. Configure this behavior with care. It is valid only when the binlog is guaranteed to contain the entire history of the database. +
 +
`schema_only` - the connector runs a snapshot of the schemas and not the data. This setting is useful when you do not need the topics to contain a consistent snapshot of the data but need them to have only the changes since the connector was started. +
 +
`schema_only_recovery` - this is a recovery setting for a connector that has already been capturing changes. When you restart the connector, this setting enables recovery of a corrupted or lost database history topic. You might set it periodically to "clean up" a database history topic that has been growing unexpectedly. Database history topics require infinite retention.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-locking-mode]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-locking-mode, `snapshot.locking{zwsp}.mode`>>
|`minimal`
a|Controls whether and how long the connector holds the global MySQL read lock, which prevents any updates to the database, while the connector is performing a snapshot. Possible settings are: +
 +
`minimal` - the connector holds the global read lock for only the initial portion of the snapshot during which the connector reads the database schemas and other metadata. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table. The connector can do this in a consistent fashion by using a REPEATABLE READ transaction. This is the case even when the global read lock is no longer held and other MySQL clients are updating the database. +
 +
`minimal_percona` - the connector holds link:https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.7/management/backup_locks.html[the global backup lock] for only the initial portion of the snapshot during which the connector reads the database schemas and other metadata. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table. The connector can do this in a consistent fashion by using a REPEATABLE READ transaction. This is the case even when the global backup lock is no longer held and other MySQL clients are updating the database. This mode does not flush tables to disk, is not blocked by long-running reads, and is available only in Percona Server. +
 +
`extended` - blocks all writes for the duration of the snapshot. Use this setting if there are clients that are submitting operations that MySQL excludes from REPEATABLE READ semantics. +
 +
`none` - prevents the connector from acquiring any table locks during the snapshot. While this setting is allowed with all snapshot modes, it is safe to use if and _only_ if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is running. For tables defined with MyISAM engine, the tables would still be locked despite this property being set as MyISAM acquires a table lock. This behavior is unlike InnoDB engine, which acquires row level locks.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-include-collection-list]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-include-collection-list, `snapshot.include.collection.list`>>
| All tables specified in `table.include.list`
|An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match names of schemas specified in `table.include.list` for which you *want* to take the snapshot.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-select-statement-overrides]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-select-statement-overrides, `snapshot.select{zwsp}.statement{zwsp}.overrides`>>
|
|Controls which table rows are included in snapshots. This property affects snapshots only. It does not affect events captured from the binlog. Specify a comma-separated list of fully-qualified table names in the form _databaseName{zwsp}.tableName_. +
 +
For each table that you specify, also specify another configuration property: `snapshot{zwsp}.select{zwsp}.statement{zwsp}.overrides{zwsp}._DB_NAME_._TABLE_NAME_`. For example, the name of the other configuration property might be:  `snapshot{zwsp}.select{zwsp}.statement{zwsp}.overrides{zwsp}.customers{zwsp}.orders`. Set this property to a `SELECT` statement that obtains only the rows that you want in the snapshot. When the connector performs a snapshot, it executes this `SELECT` statement to retrieve data from that table. +
 +
A possible use case for setting these properties is large, append-only tables. You can specify a `SELECT` statement that sets a specific point for where to start a snapshot, or where to resume a snapshot if a previous snapshot was interrupted.

|[[mysql-property-min-row-count-to-stream-results]]<<mysql-property-min-row-count-to-stream-results, `min.row.count.to{zwsp}.stream.results`>>
|`1000`
|During a snapshot, the connector queries each table for which the connector is configured to capture changes. The connector uses each query result to produce a read event that contains data for all rows in that table. This property determines whether the MySQL connector puts results for a table into memory, which is fast but requires large amounts of memory, or streams the results, which can be slower but work for very large tables. The setting of this property specifies the minimum number of rows a table must contain before the connector streams results. +
 +
To skip all table size checks and always stream all results during a snapshot, set this property to `0`.

|[[mysql-property-heartbeat-interval-ms]]<<mysql-property-heartbeat-interval-ms, `heartbeat.interval{zwsp}.ms`>>
|`0`
|Controls how frequently the connector sends heartbeat messages to a Kafka topic. The default behavior is that the connector does not send heartbeat messages. +
 +
Heartbeat messages are useful for monitoring whether the connector is receiving change events from the database. Heartbeat messages might help decrease the number of change events that need to be re-sent when a connector restarts. To send heartbeat messages, set this property to a positive integer, which indicates the number of milliseconds between heartbeat messages. 

|[[mysql-property-heartbeat-topics-prefix]]<<mysql-property-heartbeat-topics-prefix, `heartbeat.topics{zwsp}.prefix`>>
|`__debezium-heartbeat`
|Controls the name of the topic to which the connector sends heartbeat messages. The topic name has this pattern: +
 +
_heartbeat.topics.prefix_._server.name_ +
 +
For example, if the database server name is `fulfillment`, the default topic name is `__debezium-heartbeat.fulfillment`.

|[[mysql-property-database-initial-statements]]<<mysql-property-database-initial-statements, `database.initial{zwsp}.statements`>>
|
|A semicolon separated list of SQL statements to be executed when a JDBC connection, not the connection that is reading the transaction log, to the database is established.
To specify a semicolon as a character in a SQ statement and not as a delimiter, use two semicolons, (`;;`). +
 +
The connector might establish JDBC connections at its own discretion, so this property is ony for configuring session parameters. It is not for executing DML statements.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-delay-ms]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-delay-ms, `snapshot.delay.ms`>>
|
|An interval in milliseconds that the connector should wait before performing a snapshot when the connector starts. If you are starting multiple connectors in a cluster, this property is useful for avoiding snapshot interruptions, which might cause re-balancing of connectors. 

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-fetch-size]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-fetch-size, `snapshot.fetch.size`>>
|
|During a snapshot, the connector reads table content in batches of rows. This property specifies the maximum number of rows in a batch.

|[[mysql-property-snapshot-lock-timeout-ms]]<<mysql-property-snapshot-lock-timeout-ms, `snapshot.lock{zwsp}.timeout.ms`>>
|`10000`
|Positive integer that specifies the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait to obtain table locks when performing a snapshot. If the connector cannot acquire table locks in this time interval, the snapshot fails. See {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-snapshots[how MySQL connectors perform database snapshots].

|[[mysql-property-enable-time-adjuster]]<<mysql-property-enable-time-adjuster, `enable.time{zwsp}.adjuster`>>
|`true`
|Boolean value that indicates whether the connector converts a 2-digit year specification to 4 digits. Set to `false` when conversion is fully delegated to the database. +
 +
MySQL allows users to insert year values with either 2-digits or 4-digits. For 2-digit values, the value gets mapped to a year in the range 1970 - 2069. The default behavior is that the connector does the conversion. 

ifdef::community[]
|[[mysql-property-source-struct-version]]<<mysql-property-source-struct-version, `source.struct{zwsp}.version`>>
|`v2`
|Schema version for the `source` block in {prodname} events.  {prodname} 0.10 introduced a few breaking changes to the structure of the `source` block in order to unify the exposed structure across all the connectors. +
 +
By setting this option to `v1`, the structure used in earlier versions can be produced. However, this setting is not recommended and is planned for removal in a future {prodname} version.
endif::community[]

|[[mysql-property-sanitize-field-names]]<<mysql-property-sanitize-field-names, `sanitize.field{zwsp}.names`>>
|`true` if connector configuration sets the `key{zwsp}.converter` or `value{zwsp}.converter` property to the Avro converter. +
`false` if not.
|Indicates whether field names are sanitized to adhere to {link-prefix}:{link-avro-serialization}#avro-naming[Avro naming requirements].

|[[mysql-property-skipped-operations]]<<mysql-property-skipped-operations, `skipped.operations`>>
|
|Comma-separated list of oplog operations to skip during streaming. Values that you can specify are: `c` for inserts, `u` for updates, `d` for deletes. By default, no operations are skipped.

.Pass-through configuration properties

The MySQL connector also supports {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-pass-through-configuration-properties[pass-through configuration properties] that are used when creating the Kafka producer and consumer. Specifically, all connector configuration properties that begin with the `database.history.producer.` prefix are used (without the prefix) when creating the Kafka producer that writes to the database history. All properties that begin with the prefix `database.history.consumer.` are used (without the prefix) when creating the Kafka consumer that reads the database history upon connector start-up.

For example, the following connector configuration properties can be used to secure connections to the Kafka broker:

----
database.history.producer.security.protocol=SSL
database.history.producer.ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/kafka.server.keystore.jks
database.history.producer.ssl.keystore.password=test1234
database.history.producer.ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/kafka.server.truststore.jks
database.history.producer.ssl.truststore.password=test1234
database.history.producer.ssl.key.password=test1234
database.history.consumer.security.protocol=SSL
database.history.consumer.ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/kafka.server.keystore.jks
database.history.consumer.ssl.keystore.password=test1234

== Monitoring

The {prodname} MySQL connector provides three types of metrics that are in addition to the built-in support for JMX metrics that Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect provide.

* {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-snapshot-metrics[Snapshot metrics] provide information about connector operation while performing a snapshot.
* {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-binlog-metrics[Binlog metrics] provide information about connector operation when the connector is reading the binlog.
* {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-schema-history-metrics[Schema history metrics] provide information about the status of the connector's schema history.

{link-prefix}:{link-debezium-monitoring}[{prodname} monitoring documentation] provides details for how to expose these metrics by using JMX.

// Type: reference
// ModuleID: monitoring-debezium-during-snapshots-of-mysql-databases

=== Snapshot metrics

The *MBean* is `debezium.mysql:type=connector-metrics,context=snapshot,server=_<database.server.name>_`.

include::{partialsdir}/modules/all-connectors/ref-connector-monitoring-snapshot-metrics.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The {prodname} MySQL connector also provides the `HoldingGlobalLock` custom snapshot metric. This metric is set to a Boolean value that indicates whether the connector currently holds a global or table write lock. 

// Type: reference

[[mysql-binlog-metrics]]
=== Binlog metrics

The *MBean* is `debezium.mysql:type=connector-metrics,context=binlog,server=<database.server.name>`.

Transaction-related attributes are available only if binlog event buffering is enabled. See {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-property-binlog-buffer-size[`binlog.buffer.size`] in the advanced connector configuration properties for more details.

include::{partialsdir}/modules/all-connectors/ref-connector-monitoring-streaming-metrics.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The {prodname} MySQL connector also provides the following custom binlog metrics:

.Descriptions of custom binlog metrics
[cols="3,2,5",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Description

|[[binlog-filename]]<<binlog-filename,`BinlogFilename`>>
|`string`
|The name of the binlog file that the connector has most recently read.

|[[binlog-position]]<<binlog-position,`BinlogPosition`>>
|`long`
|The most recent position (in bytes) within the binlog that the connector has read.

|[[is-gtid-mode-enabled]]<<is-gtid-mode-enabled,`IsGtidModeEnabled`>>
|`boolean`
|Flag that denotes whether the connector is currently tracking GTIDs from MySQL server.

|[[gtid-set]]<<gtid-set,`GtidSet`>>
|`string`
|The string representation of the most recent GTID set processed by the connector when reading the binlog.

|[[number-of-skipped-events]]<<number-of-skipped-events,`NumberOfSkipped{zwsp}Events`>>
|`long`
|The number of events that have been skipped by the MySQL connector. Typically events are skipped due to a malformed or unparseable event from MySQL's binlog.

|[[number-of-disconnects]]<<number-of-disconnects,`NumberOfDisconnects`>>
|`long`
|The number of disconnects by the MySQL connector.

|[[number-of-rolled-back-transactions]]<<number-of-rolled-back-transactions,`NumberOfRolledBack{zwsp}Transactions`>>
|`long`
|The number of processed transactions that were rolled back and not streamed.

|[[number-of-not-well-formed-transactions]]<<number-of-not-well-formed-transactions,`NumberOfNotWell{zwsp}FormedTransactions`>>
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not conformed to the expected protocol of `BEGIN` + `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`. This value should be `0` under normal conditions.

|[[number-of-large-transactions]]<<number-of-large-transactions,`NumberOfLarge{zwsp}Transactions`>>
|`long`
|The number of transactions that have not fit into the look-ahead buffer. For optimal performance, this value should be significantly smaller than `NumberOfCommittedTransactions` and `NumberOfRolledBackTransactions`.

// Type: concept
// ModuleID: how-debezium-mysql-connectors-handle-faults-and-problems
// Title: How {prodname} MySQL connectors handle faults and problems
[[mysql-when-things-go-wrong]]
== Behavior when things go wrong

{prodname} is a distributed system that captures all changes in multiple upstream databases; it never misses or loses an event. When the system is operating normally or being managed carefully then {prodname} provides _exactly once_ delivery of every change event record. 

If a fault does happen then the system does not lose any events. However, while it is recovering from the fault, it might repeat some change events. In these abnormal situations, {prodname}, like Kafka, provides _at least once_ delivery of change events.

ifdef::community[]
The rest of this section describes how {prodname} handles various kinds of faults and problems.

endif::product[]

[id="debezium-mysql-connector-configuration-and-startup-errors"]
=== Configuration and startup errors

In the following situations, the connector fails when trying to start, reports an error or exception in the log, and stops running:

* The connector's configuration is invalid.
* The connector cannot successfully connect to the MySQL server by using the specified connection parameters.
* The connector is attempting to restart at a position in the binlog for which MySQL no longer has the history available.

In these cases, the error message has details about the problem and possibly a suggested workaround. After you correct the configuration or address the MySQL problem, restart the connector.

[id="mysql-becomes-unavailable-while-debezium-is-running"]
=== MySQL becomes unavailable

If your MySQL server becomes unavailable, the {prodname} MySQL connector fails with an error and the connector stops. When the server is available again, restart the connector.

However, if GTIDs are enabled for a highly available MySQL cluster, you can restart the connector immediately. It will connect to a different MySQL server in the cluster, find the location in the server's binlog that represents the last transaction, and begin reading the new server's binlog from that specific location.

If GTIDs are not enabled, the connector records the binlog position of only the MySQL server to which it was connected. To restart from the correct binlog position, you must reconnect to that specific server.

[id="debezium-mysql-kafka-connect-process-stops-gracefully"]
=== Kafka Connect stops gracefully

When Kafka Connect stops gracefully, there is a short delay while the {prodname} MySQL connector tasks are stopped and restarted on new Kafka Connect processes.

[id="debezium-mysql-kafka-connect-process-crashes"]
=== Kafka Connect process crashes

If Kafka Connect crashes, the process stops and any {prodname} MySQL connector tasks terminate without their most recently-processed offsets being recorded. In distributed mode, Kafka Connect restarts the connector tasks on other processes. However, the MySQL connector resumes from the last offset recorded by the earlier processes. This means that the replacement tasks might generate some of the same events processed prior to the crash, creating duplicate events.

Each change event message includes source-specific information that you can use to identify duplicate events, for example: 

* Event origin
* MySQL server's event time
* The binlog file name and position
* GTIDs (if used)

[id="debezium-mysql-kafka-process-becomes-unavailable"]
=== Kafka becomes unavailable

The Kafka Connect framework records {prodname} change events in Kafka by using the Kafka producer API. If the Kafka brokers become unavailable, the {prodname} MySQL connector pauses until the connection is reestablished and the connector resumes where it left off.

[id="mysql-purges-binlog-files-used-by-debezium"]
=== MySQL purges binlog files

If the {prodname} MySQL connector stops for too long, the MySQL server purges older binlog files and the connector's last position may be lost. When the connector is restarted, the MySQL server no longer has the starting point and the connector performs another initial snapshot. If the snapshot is disabled, the connector fails with an error.

See {link-prefix}:{link-mysql-connector}#mysql-snapshots[snapshots] for details about how MySQL connectors perform initial snapshots.
