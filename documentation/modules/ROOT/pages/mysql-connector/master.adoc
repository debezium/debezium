= {prodname} connector for MySQL

MySQL has a binary log (binlog) that records all operations in the order in which they are committed to the database. This includes changes to table schemas and the data within tables. MySQL uses the binlog for replication and recovery.

The {prodname} MySQL connector reads the binlog and produces change events for row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations and records the change events in a Kafka topic. Client applications read those Kafka topics.
