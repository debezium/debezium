[[timezone-converter-introduction]]

When {prodname} emits event records, the timezone values for timestamp fields in the record can vary depending on the type and configuration of the data source.
To maintain data consistency and precision within data processing pipelines and applications, you can use the `Timezone Converter` SMT to ensure that event records use a consistent timezone to represent timestamp data.

The SMT converts the value of the specified field to the target timezone by using the `converted.timezone` configuration option.
You can specify the target timezone as a geographic timezone, for example,  `America/New_York`, or as a UTC offset, such as `+02:00`.
It is assumed that the fields of the record are in UTC.
Along with the specified timezone, the SMT also provides configuration options to include or exclude specific fields from timezone conversion using the `include.list` and `exclude.list` configuration options.

The SMT supports all Debezium and Kafka Connect temporal and non-temporal types.

[NOTE]
====
To comply with daylight savings time, you must specify a geographic timezone in the `converted.timezone` configuration option.
If you specify a UTC offset, the transform applies a fixed offset from UTC that isn't accurate for regions that observe daylight savings time.
Providing a fixed UTC offset is useful when converting timestamp fields to a specific timezone that does not observe daylight saving time.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `include.list` and `exclude.list` configuration options are mutually exclusive. You must specify only one of the options.
====

The SMT also allows conversion of event metadata fields in the source information block, such as `ts_ms` to the target timezone. In order to convert the metadata fields, you must include the `source` prefix in the `fieldname` of the `include.list` or `exclude.list` configuration option.

[NOTE]
====
If the schema for timestamp fields in the source information block, like `ts_ms`, is currently set to `INT64`, which is not a timestamp type, future releases aim to support the conversion of such fields by introducing compatibility for a timestamp schema.

[[timezone-converter-usage]]

[[basic-example-timezone-converter]]
== Example: Basic configuration

Configure the `TimezoneConverter` SMT in the Kafka Connect configuration for a connector to convert the time-based fields in an event record to a target timezone.

For example, to convert all timestamp fields in an event record from UTC to the `Pacific/Easter` timezone, add the following lines to your connector configuration:

[source]
----
transforms=convertTimezone
transforms.convertTimezone.type=io.debezium.transforms.TimezoneConverter
transforms.convertTimezone.converted.timezone=Pacific/Easter

=== Effect of applying the `TimezoneConverter` SMT

The following examples show the timestamp fields in an event record before and after applying the `TimezoneConverter` transformation.

The SMT converts the original UTC value of the `created_at` field to the time in the target `Pacific/Easter` timezone that is specified in the xref:basic-example-timezone-converter[Basic configuration] example.
The SMT also adds an `event_timestamp` field.

[[advanced-example-timezone-converter]]
== Example: Advanced configuration

Instead of converting all timestamp fields in an event record, you can configure the SMT to convert specific fields only.
The following example shows how you might use the `include.list` option in the SMT configuration to convert only the `created_at`, and `updated_at` timestamp fields in an event record.
The following configuration uses a fixed offset, rather than a geographic timezone designator, to convert the time from UTC to `+05:30`.

[source]
----
transforms=convertTimezone
transforms.convertTimezone.type=io.debezium.transforms.TimezoneConverter
transforms.convertTimezone.converted.timezone=+05:30
transforms.convertTimezone.include.list=source:customers:created_at,customers:updated_at
----

In some cases, you might want to exclude specific timestamp fields from timezone conversion.
For example, to exclude the `updated_at` timestamp field in an event record from timezone conversion, use the `exclude.list` configuration option as in the following example:

[source]
----
transforms=convertTimezone
transforms.convertTimezone.type=io.debezium.transforms.TimezoneConverter
transforms.convertTimezone.converted.timezone=+05:30
transforms.convertTimezone.exclude.list=source:customers:updated_at
