{prodname} has extensive logging built into its connectors,
and you can change the logging configuration to control which of these log statements appear in the logs
and where those logs are sent.
{prodname} (as well as Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Zookeeper) use the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/[Log4j] logging framework for Java.

By default, the connectors produce a fair amount of useful information when they start up,
but then produce very few logs when the connector is keeping up with the source databases.
This is often sufficient when the connector is operating normally,
but may not be enough when the connector is behaving unexpectedly.
In such cases, you can change the logging level so that the connector generates much more verbose log messages describing what the connector is doing and what it is not doing.
