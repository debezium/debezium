{prodname} Management Platform aims to simplify the deployment of {prodname} to various environments in a highly opinionated manner.
To achieve this goal, the platform uses a data-centric view of {prodname} components.

It is for us a normal evolution from {prodname} Server. We have provided the operator - to easily operate it in Kubernetes environments - and now we are providing a high-level abstraction to deploy your data pipelines in different environments leveraging on {prodname} Server.

== Basic concepts
In {prodname} Management Platform there are four main concepts:

Source:: Defines the source of your data
Destination:: Defines the destination of your data
Transform:: Define how a single data is transformed
Pipeline:: Defines how your data flows from a source to a destination while being transformed along the way.

Once you define a pipeline, how it will be deployed is in charge of the platform.

=== Architecture
The platform is composed of two main components:

Conductor:: The back-end component which provides a set of APIs to orchestrate and control {prodname} deployments.
Stage:: The front-end component which provides a user interface to interact with the Conductor.

The conductor component itself is composed of several subcomponents:

API Server:: The main entry point, it provides a set of APIs to interact with the platform.
Watcher:: Component responsible for the actual communication with deployment environment (e.g. {prodname} Operator in K8s cluster).

== Installation

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the only supported environment is Kubernetes.
====

**Prerequisites**

* Helm
* Kubernetes cluster with an ingress controller

Installation is provided trough https://helm.sh/[Helm] chart.
The first step is to add the {prodname} charts repos with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add debezium https://charts.debezium.io
----

after that, you can install a specific version with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
helm install debezium-platform debezium/debezium-platform --version 3.1.0-beta1 --set database.enabled=true --set domain.url=platform.debezium.io
----

as an alternative to this, you can also install it via OCI artifact with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
helm install debezium-platform --set database.enabled=true --set domain.url=platform.debezium.io --version 3.1.0-beta1 oci://quay.io/debezium-charts/debezium-platform
----

the `domain.url` is the only required property, and it is used as `host` in the `Ingress` definition.
The `database.enabled` properties has been added for simplicity since in that way the PostgreSQL database, required by the conductor service, is automatically deployed.
This is discouraged in production environment, so in that case please do not use it and provide instead your database instance.

The following tables lists all the chart's properties:

[cols="1,3,1", options="header"]

== Use the platform

In this section we will do a walkthrough of the different functionalities of the UI.

=== Source
In this section, you can define the sources of your data.
All {prodname} supported databases are available.
When you create a source, it can be shared between different pipelines, which means that every change to a source will be reflected in every pipeline that uses it.

==== Create a new source
In this section, you can configure your source in two different ways. You can use the `Form Editor`, where you can enter the name of the source and a description, and then specify the list of properties for the specific source.
Refer to the connector-specific documentation page for the available properties.

==== Configure the source with Smart Editor
The other option is the `Smart Editor`, where you can directly edit/paste the `JSON` configuration.
For those familiar with {prodname}, this is quite similar to the Kafka Connect configuration or {prodname} Server with small differences.
The common part is the `config` section, in fact you can more or less copy the standard {prodname} configuration `config` section under the `config` property.

For example, if you have the following configuration:

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  "name": "inventory-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "database.hostname": "mysql",
    "database.port": "3306",
    "database.user": "debezium",
    "database.password": "dbz",
    "database.server.id": "184054",
    "topic.prefix": "dbserver1",
    "database.include.list": "inventory"
  }
}
----

You just need to copy the `config` section, removing the `connector.class`, since it is already provided with the `type`.
In the future we will eventually support the Kafka Connect and/or Debezium Server format directly.

The final `json` should something like the following
[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
    "name": "my-source",
    "description": "This is my first source",
    "type": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "schema": "schema123",
    "vaults": [],
    "config": {
        "database.hostname": "mysql",
        "database.port": "3306",
        "database.user": "debezium",
        "database.password": "dbz",
        "database.server.id": "184054",
        "topic.prefix": "dbserver1",
        "database.include.list": "inventory"
    }
}
----

==== Delete a source
To delete a source, go to the `Source` menu and then click the `action` menu of the source you want to delete, then click `Delete`.
A source can be deleted only if it is not used in any pipeline; otherwise, you will receive an error.
When the source is no longer used in any pipeline, you can delete it using the `Delete` option.

==== Edit a source
To edit a source, go to the `Source` menu and then click the `action` menu of the source you want to edit, then click `Edit`.

[NOTE]
====
Editing a source will affect all pipelines that use it.
====

=== Destination
In this section, you can define the destinations where your source data will be sent.
All {prodname} Server sinks are available as destination.
When you create a destination, it can be shared between different pipelines, which means that every change to a destination will be reflected in every pipeline that uses it.

==== Create a new destination
In this section, you can configure your destination in two different ways. You can use the `Form Editor`, where you can enter the name of the destination and a description, and then specify the list of properties for the specific destination system.
Refer to the {prodname} sink-specific documentation page for the available properties.

==== Configure the destination with Smart Editor
The other option is the Smart Editor, where you can directly edit/paste the JSON configuration.
For those familiar with {prodname}, this is quite similar to {prodname} Server `sink` configuration section with small differences.
Usually you have that the configuration of a particular sink are prefixed with `debezium.sink.<sink_name>` where `<sink_name` is the sink `type`.

For example, if you have the following configuration:

[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
# ...

debezium.sink.type=pubsub
debezium.sink.pubsub.project.id=debezium-tutorial-local
debezium.sink.pubsub.address=pubsub:8085

# ..
----

You just need to take all properties prefixed with `debezium.sink.pubsub` and transform in `json` format.
In the future we will eventually support the Kafka Connect and/or Debezium Server format directly.

The final `json` should something like the following
[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  "name": "test-destination",
  "type": "pubsub",
  "description": "Some funny destination",
  "schema": "dummy",
  "vaults": [],
  "config": {
    "project.id": "debezium-tutorial-local",
    "address": "pubsub:8085"
  }
}
----

==== Delete a destination
To delete a destination, go to the `Destination` menu and then click the `action` menu of the destination you want to delete, then click `Delete`.
A destination can be deleted only if it is not used in any pipeline; otherwise, you will receive an error.
When the destination is no longer used in any pipeline, you can delete it using the `Delete` button.

==== Edit a destination
To edit a destination, go to the `Destination` menu and then click the `action` menu of the destination you want to edit, then click `Edit`.

[NOTE]
Editing a destination will affect all pipelines that use it.

=== Transforms
In this section you can manage the transformations that you want to use on your data pipeline.

Currently, we support all {prodname} provided transforms and also Kafka Connect ones.

As for `Source` and `Destination`, the transform is shared between pipeline meaning that any changes will be reflected to all pipeline that uses it.

==== Create
In this section, you can configure your transform in two different ways. You can use the `Form Editor`, where you can choose the type of transform and give it a name and a description.
Then you can set the configuration specific to the transform type.

You can optionally specify also a `Predicate` so that the transform will be applied only to records that meets the specified condition.
You just need to choose the predicate from the list and set its properties.

==== Configure the transform with Smart Editor
The other option is the `Smart Editor`, where you can directly edit/paste the JSON configuration.

For those familiar with {prodname}, this format sounds different, but it can be easily adapted.

Usually you have that the configuration of a particular transform are prefixed with `transofrms.<transform_name>` where `<transform_name` is the name you give to the transform.

For example, if you have the following configuration:

[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
# ...

transforms=unwrap
transforms.unwrap.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState
transforms.unwrap.add.fields=op
transforms.unwrap.add.headers=db,table
predicates=onlyProducts
predicates.onlyProducts.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatches
predicates.onlyProducts.pattern=inventory.inventory.products

# ..
----

You just need to take all properties prefixed with `transforms.unwrap`, except for the `transforms.unwrap.type`, and convert to `json` format.
Same logic applies to predicates.

In the future we will eventually support the Kafka Connect format directly.

The final `json` should something like the following

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  "name": "Debezium marker",
  "description": "Extract Debezium payloa d",
  "type": "io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState",
  "schema": "string",
  "vaults": [],
  "config": {
    "add.fields": "op",
    "add.headers": "db,table"
  },
  "predicate": {
    "type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatches",
    "config": {
      "pattern": "inventory.inventory.products"
    },
    "negate": false
  }
}
----
==== Edit
To edit a transform, go to the `Transform` menu and then click the `action` menu of the destination you want to edit, then click `Edit`.

[NOTE]
Editing a destination will affect all pipelines that use it.

==== Delete
To delete a transform, go to the `Transform` menu and then click the `action` menu of the transform you want to delete, then click `Delete`.
A transform can be deleted only if it is not used in any pipeline; otherwise, you will receive an error.
When the transform is no longer used in any pipeline, you can delete it using the `Delete` button.

=== Pipeline
The pipeline section is the place where you connect the "dots". You can define where your data comes, how to eventually transform them and where they should go.

==== Create
In the pipeline menu you can click on `Create your first pipeline` and you will get into the `Pipeline Designer`.
Here you can add the pieces that composes you data pipeline. First of all, you need to add a source clicking on the `+ Source` box and the you can either choose a previously created source or directly create a new one.

Similarly, you can add a destination clicking on the `+ Destination` box.

If you want to apply some transformation to your data, you can add it in the same way just clicking on the `+ Transform` box.

When a transform as a predicate configured, you will see a image:predicate-icon.png[alt text] on top of it. A tooltip will show the name of the predicate used.
