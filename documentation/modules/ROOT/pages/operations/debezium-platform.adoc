{prodname} Management Platform aims to simplify the deployment of {prodname} to various environments in a highly opinionated manner.
To achieve this goal, the platform uses a data-centric view of {prodname} components.

Implementing the platform represents a natural evolution from {prodname} Server. Past releases provided the {prodname} operator to simplify operation in Kubernetes environments. With the introduction of the platform, {prodname} now provides a high-level abstraction to deploy your data pipelines in different environments while leveraging {prodname} Server.

== Basic concepts
In {prodname} Management Platform there are four main concepts:

Source:: Defines the source of your data.
Destination:: Defines the destination of your data.
Transform:: Defines how a single data event is transformed as it flows through the pipeline.
Pipeline:: Defines how data flows from a source to a destination while being transformed along the way.

After you define a pipeline, it is deployed based on how you configure the platform.

Each pipeline is mapped to a {prodname} Server instance. 
For the Kubernetes environment (currently, the only supported environment) the server instance corresponds to a `DebeziumServer` custom resource.

=== Architecture

The platform is composed of the following components:

Conductor:: The back-end component that provides a set of APIs to orchestrate and control {prodname} deployments.
Stage:: The front-end component that provides a user interface to interact with the Conductor.

The conductor component itself is composed of the following subcomponents:

API Server:: The main entry point.
It provides a set of APIs to interact with the platform.
Watcher:: The component that is responsible for the actual communication with the deployment environment (for example, the {prodname} Operator in a Kubernetes cluster).

== Installation

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the only supported environment is Kubernetes.
====

.Prerequisites

* Helm
* Kubernetes cluster with an ingress controller

Installation is provided through a https://helm.sh/[Helm] chart.

.Procedure

1. Enter the following command to add the {prodname} charts repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm repo add debezium https://charts.debezium.io
----

2.  Enter one of the following commands to install the version of the platform that you want:
+
[source, bash]
----
helm install debezium-platform debezium/debezium-platform --version 3.1.0-beta1 --set database.enabled=true --set domain.url=platform.debezium.io
----
+
Or, to use an OCI artifact to install the platform, enter the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
helm install debezium-platform --set database.enabled=true --set domain.url=platform.debezium.io --version 3.1.0-beta1 oci://quay.io/debezium-charts/debezium-platform
----
+
The `domain.url` is the only required property; it is used as `host` in the `Ingress` definition.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the preceding examples, the `database.enabled` property is used.
This property helps to simplify deployment in testing environments by automatically deploying the PostgreSQL database that is required by the conductor service. 
When deploying in a production environment, do not enable automatic deployment of the PostgreSQL database.
Instead, specify an existing database instance, by setting the `database.name`, `database.host`, and other properties required to connect to the database. 
See the following table for more information.

== Using the platform

You can use the platform UI to perform a number of different tasks.

=== Defining sources

Use the **Source** section of the UI to specify the database that hosts your data.
You can configure any database that {prodname} supports as a source.
The source that you create can be shared among multiple pipelines.
Changes to a source are reflected in every pipeline that uses it.

==== Creating a source

You can use either of the following editors to configure a source:

**Form Editor**:: Enables you to specify the name and description of the source, along with a list of properties.
For a complete list of the properties that are available for a connector, see the connector documentation.

**Smart Editor**:: Enables you to use JSON to define the source configuration.


[.responsive]
video::CVY4Y4kAs_E[youtube, title="Create, edit and remove a source"]


==== Configuring a source with the Smart Editor

You can use the **Smart Editor** to specify the JSON that defines the source configuration.
You can enter and edit `JSON` directly in the editor, or paste `JSON` from an external source into the editor.
With a few small differences, the JSON that you use to configure a data source in the **Smart Editor** is nearly identical to the JSON in the `config` section that defines the configuration for a {prodname} connector on Kafka Connect or in the {prodname} Server.
In fact, you can more or less directly copy the section from the `config` property of a standard {prodname} configuration into the **Smart Editor**.
You need only remove the `connector.class`, because for the data source configuration, the `type` is already provided.

NOTE: **Smart Editor** support for directly using the Kafka Connect or {prodname} Server format for configuring a connector is planned for a future release.

For example, consider the following JSON for specifying the configuration for a {prodname} MySQL connector:

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  "name": "inventory-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "database.hostname": "mysql",
    "database.port": "3306",
    "database.user": "debezium",
    "database.password": "dbz",
    "database.server.id": "184054",
    "topic.prefix": "dbserver1",
    "database.include.list": "inventory"
  }
}
----

To adapt the preceding configuration for use in defining a MySQL data source in the **Smart Editor**, copy the `config` section and remove the `connector.class`.

The following example shows the JSON that you would use to define a MySQL data source in the **Smart Editor**.

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
    "name": "my-source",
    "description": "This is my first source",
    "type": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "schema": "schema123",
    "vaults": [],
    "config": {
        "database.hostname": "mysql",
        "database.port": "3306",
        "database.user": "debezium",
        "database.password": "dbz",
        "database.server.id": "184054",
        "topic.prefix": "dbserver1",
        "database.include.list": "inventory"
    }
}
----

==== Deleting a source

.Prerequisites

* The source that you want to delete is not in use in any pipeline.

.Procedure

* From the platform UI, open the **Source** menu, click the **Action** menu for the source that you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.
+
An error results if you attempt to delete a source that is in use.
If the operation returns an error, verify that the source is no longer used in any pipeline, and then repeat the delete operation.

==== Editing a source

To edit a source, from the platform UI, open to the **Source** menu, click the **Action** menu of the source that you want to edit, and then click **Edit**.

[NOTE]
====
Editing a source will affect all pipelines that use it.
====

=== Creating destinations

Use the **Destination** section of the UI to specify the data sink to which the platform sends source data.
All {prodname} Server sinks are available as destination.
When you create a destination, it can be shared between different pipelines, which means that every change to a destination will be reflected in every pipeline that uses it.

[.responsive]
video::vijxIYwOR4k[youtube, title="Create, edit and remove a destination"]

==== Creating a destination

Use the **Destination** section of the UI to configure the sink destinations to which the platform sends data. 
You can use either of the following editors to configure a destination:

**Form Editor**:: Enables you to specify the name and description of the destination, along with a list of properties.
For a complete list of the properties that are available for a sink connector, see the connector documentation.
**Smart Editor**:: Enables you to use JSON to define the sink configuration.


==== Configuring a destination with the Smart Editor

You can use the **Smart Editor** to specify the JSON that defines the source configuration.
You can enter and edit `JSON` directly in the editor, or paste `JSON` from an external source into the editor.
With a few small differences, the JSON that you use to configure a destination in the **Smart Editor** is nearly identical to the configuration that you use to define a {prodname} Server `sink`.

NOTE: **Smart Editor** support for directly using the {prodname} Server configuration format is planned for a future release.
Typically, in {prodname} Server, the configuration of a sink is prefixed with `debezium.sink._<sink_name>_` where `_<sink_name>_` is the sink `type`.

For example, consider the following JSON for configuring a sink destination in {prodname} Server:

[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
# ...

debezium.sink.type=pubsub
debezium.sink.pubsub.project.id=debezium-tutorial-local
debezium.sink.pubsub.address=pubsub:8085

# ..
----

To adapt the preceding configuration for use in defining a sink destination in the **Smart Editor**,  remove the prefix `debezium.sink.pubsub` and convert the configuration to JSON format.

The following example shows the JSON that you might use to define a sink destination in the **Smart Editor**.

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  "name": "test-destination",
  "type": "pubsub",
  "description": "Some funny destination",
  "schema": "dummy",
  "vaults": [],
  "config": {
    "project.id": "debezium-tutorial-local",
    "address": "pubsub:8085"
  }
}
----

==== Deleting a destination
.Prerequisites

* The sink that you want to delete is not in use in any pipeline.

.Procedure

*  From the platform UI, open the **Destination** menu, click the **Action** menu of the destination you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.
+
An error results if you attempt to delete a destination that is in use.
If the operation returns an error, verify that the destination is no longer used in any pipeline, and then repeat the delete operation.

==== Editing a destination

To edit a destination, go to the `Destination` menu and then click the `action` menu of the destination you want to edit, then click `Edit`.

[NOTE]
Editing a destination will affect all pipelines that use it.

=== Managing transforms

Use the **Transforms** section of the platform UI to manage the transformations that you want to use in your data pipeline.

Currently, the platform supports all single message transformations provided by {prodname} as well as any Kafka Connect transformations.

Transformations are shared among pipelines.
When you modify a transformation, the changes are reflected in all pipelines that use the transformation.

[.responsive]
video::UCc4A4o6HiU[youtube, title="Create, edit and remove a transform"]

==== Creating a transformation

Use the **Transforms** section of the platform UI to specify the configure and manage single message transformations.

You can use either of the following editors to configure transformations:

**Form Editor**:: Enables you to specify the name, type, and description of the transformation.
You can also set additional configuration options that are specific to the transform type.
+
Optionally, if you want to apply the transformation only to records that meet specific criteria, you can specify a predicate.
You can choose the predicate from a list, and set its properties.

**Smart Editor**:: Enables you to use JSON to configure the transformation.

==== Using the Smart Editor to configure transformations

You can use the **Smart Editor** to specify the JSON that defines the transform configuration.
You can enter and edit `JSON` directly in the editor, or paste `JSON` from an external source into the editor.

The format for configuring transformations in the Smart Editor differs from the Kafka Connect format that {prodname} uses to configure transformations, but you can easily convert between formats.

Typically, entries in the configuration of a transformation are prefixed with `transforms._<transform_name>_` where `_<transform_name_` is the name assigned to the transformation.

For example, in {prodname}, the following configuration is used with the `unwrap` (`ExtractNewRecordState`) transformation:

[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
# ...

transforms=unwrap
transforms.unwrap.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState
transforms.unwrap.add.fields=op
transforms.unwrap.add.headers=db,table
predicates=onlyProducts
predicates.onlyProducts.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatches
predicates.onlyProducts.pattern=inventory.inventory.products

# ..
----

To adapt this configuration for use in {prodname} platform, convert the properties that include the prefix `transforms.unwrap`, except for `transforms.unwrap.type`, to JSON format.
Apply the same process to convert predicate statements.

NOTE: **Smart Editor** support for directly using the Kafka Connect configuration format is planned for a future release.

After you convert the {prodname} configuration for the `unwrap` transformation, the following JSON results: 

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  "name": "Debezium marker",
  "description": "Extract Debezium payloa d",
  "type": "io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState",
  "schema": "string",
  "vaults": [],
  "config": {
    "add.fields": "op",
    "add.headers": "db,table"
  },
  "predicate": {
    "type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatches",
    "config": {
      "pattern": "inventory.inventory.products"
    },
    "negate": false
  }
}
----
==== Editing transformations

From the platform UI, open the **Transform** menu, click the **Action** menu for the transformation that you want to edit, and then click **Edit**.

[NOTE]
Editing a transformation affects all pipelines that use it.

==== Deleting a transformation

.Prerequisites

* The transformation that you want to delete is not in use in any pipeline.

.Procedure

*  From the platform UI, open the **Transform** menu, click the **Action** menu of the transformation you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.
+
An error results if you attempt to delete a transformation that is in use.
If the operation returns an error, verify that the transformation is no longer used in any pipeline, and then repeat the delete operation.

=== Creating and managing pipelines

The pipeline section is the place where you connect the "dots". You can define where your data comes, how to eventually transform them and where they should go.

[.responsive]
video::cY7TS0nWBoY[youtube, title="Create, edit and remove a pipeline"]

==== Creating pipelines

. From the platform UI, open the **Pipeline** menu and click **Create your first pipeline**  to open the **Pipeline Designer**.
+
From the **Pipeline Designer** you can add the pieces for your data pipeline.
. Click the **+ Source** box to add a source, and then choose a previously created source, or create a new source.

Click the **+ Destination** box to add a destination .

. (Optional) Click the **+ Transform** box to apply one or more transformations.

Transformations that are configured with a predicate are marked with a predicate icon (image:predicate-icon.png[Transformation configured with a predicate]).
A tooltip shows the name of the predicate.

After you finish designing your pipeline, click **Configure Pipeline**, and then specify the name, description, and logging level for the pipeline.

==== Deleting a pipeline

From the platform UI, open the **Pipeline** menu, click the **Action** menu for the pipeline that you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.
The deletion removes only the pipeline: the source, destination, and any transformations are not deleted.

==== Editing a pipeline

. From the platform UI, open the **Pipeline** menu, click the **Action** menu for the pipeline that you want to edit, and then click **Edit pipeline**.
. Use the pipeline designer to modify transformations as needed.
You can edit the name, description, and log level for the transformation.
For more information about using the pipeline designer, see xref:debezium-platform-using-the-pipeline-designer-to-remove-and-order-transformations[Using the Pipeline designer to remove and order transformations].

[id="debezium-platform-using-the-pipeline-designer-to-remove-and-order-transformations"]
===== Using the Pipeline designer to remove and order transformations

From the **Pipeline designer**, you can delete transformations, or rearrange the order in which they run.

.Deleting a transformation

. From the **Pipeline designer**, click the pencil icon (image:transformation-box-edit.png[pencil]) in the **Transform** box.
. From the **Transform list**, click the trash icon next to the name of the transform.

.Rearranging transformations

If you configure a connector to use multiple transformations, you can use the **Transform list** in the **Pipeline designer** to specify the order in which they are applied.
The first transformation in the list processes the message first.

. From the **Pipeline designer**, click the pencil icon (image:transformation-box-edit.png[pencil]) in the **Transform** box.
. From the  **Transform list**, drag transformations into the order in which you want to apply them, and then click **Apply**.

==== Monitoring the pipeline

The {prodname} platform provides easy access to the pipeline logs.
. From the platform UI, click **Pipeline**, click the name of the pipeline you want to monitor, and then click **Pipeline logs**.
