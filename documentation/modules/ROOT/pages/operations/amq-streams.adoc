The following describes how to set up the https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/download/[Debezium 1.0.0 Technology Preview connectors] for change data capture on Red Hat's https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift] container platform.

[NOTE]
====
This and other documentation pages mention ```Debezium 1.0.0 Technology Preview```, please note that this version corresponds to version ```1.0.0.Beta2``` of upstream https://github.com/debezium/debezium/tree/v1.0.0.Beta2[Debezium project].
====

== Apache Kafka Deployment

For setting up Apache Kafka and Apache Kafka Connect on OpenShift, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-amq#streams[Red Hat AMQ Streams] can be used, which offers "Kafka as a Service".
It consists of an enterprise grade operator and images that bring Kafka to OpenShift.

Follow these steps to prepare your Kafka cluster:

* Install the AMQ Streams operator by following steps in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.5/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/getting-started-str#downloads-str[AMQ docs].
* Select the desired configuration and https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.5/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/getting-started-str#downloads-str[deploy your Kafka Cluster].
* Deploy https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.5/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/getting-started-str#using-kafka-connect-with-plug-ins-str[Kafka Connect s2i].

We now have a working ```Kafka cluster``` running within ```OpenShift``` with ```Kafka Connect s2i```.

After a while and depending on your Kafka configuration, these pods should be running (assuming you used "debezium-kafka-cluster" as the AMQ Streams Kafka cluster name):

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
$ oc get pods

NAME                                                      READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
debezium-kafka-cluster-entity-operator-7b6b9d4c5f-k7b92   3/3       Running     0          5m
debezium-kafka-cluster-kafka-0                            2/2       Running     0          4m
debezium-kafka-cluster-zookeeper-0                        2/2       Running     0          4m
strimzi-cluster-operator-97cd5cf7b-l58bq                  1/1       Running     0          6m
----

In addition to running pods you should have a ```DeploymentConfig``` associated with your Connect ```s2i```.

[NOTE]
====
Instead of utilising the ```KafkaConnectS2I``` you can create a new ```Dockerfile``` based on AMQ's Kafka image, including the required Debezium connectors.
The precise instruction can also be found in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.3/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift_container_platform/getting-started-str#using-kafka-connect-with-plug-ins-str[AMQ Streams documentation].
In this case the last item in the list above can be omitted.

== Debezium Deployment

To deploy a Kafka Cluster with the Debezium Technology Preview connectors we need to

* Download the connector archives
* Prepare the plugin directory structure
* Start the OpenShift s2i build to deploy the final Kafka Connect cluster

=== Preparing Directory Structure

Download the connector archives from https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/download[Red Hat Developer Portal], extract the archives, and download the required driver dependencies.
Once complete you should end with the following directory structure:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----

=== Deploying Kafka Connect with the Debezium Technology Preview

With plugin directory structure ready, all we have to do now in order to deploy our Kafka Connect cluster is triggering the ```s2i``` build.

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
# Check the name of our build config
$ oc get buildconfigs

NAME                                     TYPE     FROM     LATEST
debezium-kafka-connect-cluster-connect   Source   Binary   2

# Build and deploy Kafka Connect cluster with Debezium
$ oc start-build debezium-kafka-connect-cluster-connect --from-dir=./plugins
----

After a while all parts should be up and running:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
oc get pods

NAME                                                      READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
debezium-kafka-cluster-entity-operator-7b6b9d4c5f-k7b92   3/3       Running     0          10m
debezium-kafka-cluster-kafka-0                            2/2       Running     0          9m
debezium-kafka-cluster-zookeeper-0                        2/2       Running     0          9m
debezium-kafka-connect-cluster-connect-2-jw695            1/1       Running     0          1m
debezium-kafka-connect-cluster-connect-2-deploy           0/1       Completed   0          3m
strimzi-cluster-operator-97cd5cf7b-l58bq                  1/1       Running     0          11m
----

Alternatively, you can go to the "Pods" view of your OpenShift Web Console to confirm all pods are up and running:

== Verifying the Deployment

Next we are going to verify whether the deployment is correct by emulating the xref:tutorial.adoc[Debezium Tutorial] and following the steps in xref:operations/openshift.adoc#verifying_the_deployment[OpenShift Installation]

[NOTE]
====
You will want to change the pod names to correspond with your AMQ Streams deployment.
