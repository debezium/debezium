You can use the JMX metrics provided by link:https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperJMX.html[Zookeeper] and link:http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/kafka/monitoring.html[Kafka] to monitor {prodname}.
To use these metrics, you must enable them when you start the Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect services.
Enabling JMX involves setting the correct environment variables.
The environment variables that you must set depends on whether you are running Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect in a local installation or in Docker containers.

[NOTE]
====
If you are running multiple services on the same machine,
be sure to use distinct JMX ports for each service.
